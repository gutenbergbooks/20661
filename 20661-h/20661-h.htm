<h2>THE ROMANCE <i>of</i><br />
AN OLD FOOL</h2>


<p><span class="dropcapn">I</span><span style="margin-left: -.7em;"><b>F</b></span> it had not been for Bunsey, the
novelist, I might have attained the
heights. As a critic Bunsey has
never commanded my highest admiration,
and yet I have had my tender moments
for him. From a really exacting standpoint
he was not much of a novelist, and
to his failure to win the wealth which is
supposed to accompany fame I may have
owed much of the debt of his sustained
presence and his fondness for my tobacco.
Bunsey had started out in life with high
ideals, a resolution to lead the purely literary
existence and to supply the market
with a variety of choice, didactic essays
along the line of high thinking; but the
demand did not come up to the supply,
and presently he abandoned his original
lofty intention in favor of a sort of dubious
romance. The financial returns, however,
while a trifle more regular and encouraging,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2" href="#Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
were not of sufficient importance to
justify him in giving up his friendly claims
on my house, my library, my time, my
favorite lounge, and my best brand of
cigars, in return for which he contributed
philosophic opinions and much strenuous
advice on topics in general and literature
in particular.</p>

<p>From my childhood I have been in
the habit of keeping a diary, a running
comment on the daily incidents of my
pleasant but uneventful life, and occasionally,
when Bunsey's society seemed too
assertive and familiar, I sought to punish
him by reading long and numerous excerpts.
To do him justice he took the
chastisement meekly, and even insisted
that I was burying a remarkable talent,
sometimes going to the magnanimous extreme
of offering to introduce me to his
publisher, and to speak a good word for
me to the editors of certain magazines
with whom he maintained a brisk correspondence,
not infrequently of a querulous
nature. All these friendly offices I gently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3" href="#Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
put aside, in recalling the degradation of
Bunsey's ideals, though I went on tolerating
Bunsey, who had a good heart and an
insistent manner. In this way I possibly
deprived myself of a glorious career.</p>

<p>My ability to befriend Bunsey was due
to a felicitous chain of circumstances.
When the late Mrs. Stanhope passed to
her reward, she considerately left behind
a document making me the recipient of
her entire and not inconsiderable fortune.
This proved a most unexpected blow to
the church, which had enjoyed the honor
and pleasure of Mrs. Stanhope's association,
and which, quite naturally, had
hoped to profit by her decease. The
late Mrs. Stanhope, who I neglected to
say was, in the eyes of Heaven, the world,
and the law, my wife, had not lived with
me in that utter abandonment to conjugal
affection so much to be desired. We
married to please our families, and we
lived apart as much as possible to please
ourselves. Though not without certain
physical charms, Mrs. Stanhope was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4" href="#Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
woman of great moral rigidity and religious
austerity, who saw life through the
diminishing end of a sectarian telescope,
and who cared far more for the distant
heathen than for the local convivial pagans
who composed my <i>entourage</i>. She had
brought to me a considerable sum of
money, which I had increased by judicious
investments, and I dare say that it
was in recognition of my business ability,
as well as possibly in a moment of
becoming wifely remorse, that she bequeathed
to me her property intact. I
gave her final testimonial services wholly
in keeping with her standing as a church-woman,
and I must say for my friends,
whom she had severely ignored during
her life, that they behaved very handsomely
on that mournful occasion. They
turned out in large numbers, and testified
in other ways to their regard for her unblemished
character. I recall, not without
emotion after all these years, that
Bunsey's memorial tribute to the church
paper&mdash;for which he never received a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5" href="#Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
dollar&mdash;was a model of appreciation as
well as of Christian forgiveness and self-forgetfulness.</p>

<p>The passing of Mrs. Stanhope made it
possible for me to put into operation the
long-desired plan of retiring a little way
into the country, not too far from the
seductions of the club and the city, but
far enough to conform to the tastes of a
country gentleman who likes to whistle
to his dogs, putter over his roses, and
meditate in a comfortable library with
the poets and philosophers of his fancy.
Here, with my good house-keeper, Prudence&mdash;a
name I chose in preference to
her mother's selection, Elizabeth&mdash;and
my gardener and man of affairs, Malachy,
I lived for a number of years at peace
with the world and perfectly satisfied with
myself. Although I was dangerously
over forty, and my hair, which had been
impressively dark, was conspicuously gray
in spots, my figure was good, my dress
correct, and my mirror told me that I
was still in a position to be in the matrimonial<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6" href="#Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
running if I tried. I mention
these trifling physical details merely to
save my modesty the humiliation and
annoyance of referring to them in future,
and to prepossess the gentle reader wherever
the sex makes it highly important.</p>

<p>I do not deny that in certain moments
of loneliness which come to us, widowers
and bachelors alike, I had the impulse to
tempt again the matrimonial fortune, and
counting on my financial standing, together
with other attractions, I ran over
the eligible ladies of my acquaintance.
But one was a little too old, and another
was a good deal too flighty. One was
too fond of society, and another did not
like dogs. A fifth spoiled her chances
by an unwomanly ignorance of horticulture,
and a sixth perished miserably after
returning to me one of my most cherished
books with the leaves dog-eared and the
binding cracked. For I hold with the
greatest philosophers that she who maltreats
a book will never make a good
wife. And so the years slipped cosily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7" href="#Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
and cheerily by, while I grew more contented
with my environment and less
envious of my married friends, and whenever
temporary melancholy overtook me
I moved into the club for a month, or
slipped across the water, finding in the
change of scene immediate relief from the
monotony of widowerhood.</p>

<p>In thus fortifying myself against the
wiles of woman I was much abetted by
my good Prudence, who never ceased her
exhortations as to the sinister designs of
her sex, and who had a ready word of
discouragement for any possible candidate
who might be in the line of succession.
"I see that Rogers woman walkin' by
the house to-day, Mr. John," she would
begin, "and I see her turnin' her nose
up at the new paint on the arbor." (I
selected that color myself.) "It's queer
how that woman does give herself airs,
considerin' everybody knows she's been
ready for ten years to take the fust man
that asks her." Prudence knew that I
had escorted the elderly Miss Rogers to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8" href="#Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
the theatre only the week before, and
had commented pleasantly on the elegance
of her figure. But the slight put
upon my eye for color was too much.
Wily Prudence!</p>

<p>Or a day or two after I had rendered
an act of neighborly kindness to the bereaved
Mrs. Stebbins she would say
quite casually:</p>

<p>"I don't want to utter one word agin
the poor and afflicted, Mr. John, but
when the Widder Stebbins hit Cleo with
a broom to-day I own I b'iled over. I
shouldn't tell you if it warn't my duty."</p>

<p>Cleopatra was my favorite cocker
spaniel, and any faint impression my fair
neighbor may have made on my unguarded
heart was immediately dispelled.
Thus subtly and vigilantly my house-keeper
kept the outer gates of the citadel,
and shooed away a possible mistress as
effectually as she dispersed the predatory
hens from the garden patch.</p>

<p>But with the younger generation of
women, good Prudence was less cautious.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9" href="#Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
Any maiden under the very early twenties
she regarded fair material for my friendly
offices, and frequently she visited me
with expressions commendatory of good
conduct.</p>

<p>"I likes to see you with the children,
Mr. John, bless 'em, sir. And they do
all seem to be so fond of you. There's
nothin' that keeps the heart so young
and fresh as goin' with young people,
just as nothin' ages a man so much as
havin' a lot of widders and designin' old
maids about. Of course," she added,
with a return of her natural suspicion,
"you are old enough to be father to the
whole bunch, which keeps people from
talkin'."</p>

<p>Whether it was Prudence's approbation
or my own inclination I cannot say,
but it soon came about that I was on
paternally familiar terms with the entire
neighborhood of maidens of reasonably
tender years, and a very important factor
in young feminine councils. These artful
creatures knew exactly when their favorite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10" href="#Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
roses were in bloom, exactly when the
cherries back of the house were ripe, exactly
when it was time to go to town for
another theatre party, to give a picnic up
the river, or a small and informal dance
in the parlors. I was expected to remember
and observe all birthdays, to be
a well-spring of benevolence at Christmas,
and a free and never-failing florist at
Easter. I was the recipient of all young
griefs and troubles, and no girl ever committed
herself unconditionally to the arms
of her lover until she had talked the
matter over with Uncle John. All this,
to a good-looking man of&mdash;well, considerably
over forty, was flattering, but no
sinecure.</p>

<p>One morning, in the late spring, it came
over me unhappily that in a moment of
fatal forgetfulness I had promised to be
present that evening at a card-party&mdash;a
promise exacted by the "Rogers woman,"
<i>persona non grata</i> to Prudence. A card-party
was to me in the category with
battle and murder and sudden death, from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11" href="#Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
which we all petition to be delivered in
the book of common prayer&mdash;but how to
be delivered? I could not be called suddenly
to town, for I had already run that
excuse to its full limit. I could not conveniently
start for Europe on an hour's
notice. The plea of sickness I dismissed
as feminine and unworthy. And while I
sat debating to what extreme I could tax
my over-burdened conscience, Malachy appeared
with the information that he had
discovered unmistakable signs of cutworms
in the rose-bushes, and that the local custodians
of the trees were thundering
against an impending epidemic of brown-tailed
moth. Surely my path of duty led
to the garden. But that card-party? No,
let the cutworm work his will, and let the
brown-tailed moth corrupt; I must take
refuge in flight, however inglorious. It
was then that the good angel, who never
forsakes a well-meaning man, whispered
to me that far back in a quiet corner of
New England was the little village where
I had passed my boyhood, which I had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12" href="#Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
deserted for five and twenty years, but
which still remembered me as "Johnny"
Stanhope, thanks to the officious longevity
of the editor of the county paper.</p>

<p>The situation I explained briefly to
Prudence and Malachy, and swore them
into the conspiracy. I threw a few clothes
into a small trunk, despatched a hypocritical
note of regret to Miss Rogers, caught
the noon train, and was soon beyond the
danger line. Mrs. Lot, casting an apprehensive
glance behind her, could not have
dreaded more fearful consequences than I,
looking back on the calamity I was evading.
But as we went on and on into the
cool, quiet country, and felt the soft air
stealing down from the nearing mountains,
I began to experience a lively sense of relief
and pleasure, and to wonder why I
had so long delayed a visit to my boyhood
home.</p>

<p>I am sorry for the man whose childhood
knew only the roar and bustle and swiftly
shifting scenes of the city. For him there
is no return in after years, no illusion to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13" href="#Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
renewed, no joy of youth to be substantiated.
His habitation has passed away or
yielded to the inroads of commerce, his
landmarks have vanished, and he is bewildered
by the strange sights that time
and trade have put upon his memories.
But time has no terrors for the country-bred
boy. The Almighty does not change
the mountains and the rivers and the
great rocks that fortify the scenery, and
man is slow to push back into the far
meadowlands and the hillsides, and destroy
the simple, primitive life of the
fathers.</p>

<p>All of the joy that such a returning pilgrim
might have I felt when I left the
train at the junction, and, scorning the
pony engine and combination car supplied
in later years by the railway company as a
tribute to progress, set out to walk the two
miles to the village. Every foot of the
country I had played over as a boy. Here
was the field where Deacon Skinner did his
"hayin'"; just beyond the deacon raised
his tobacco crop. That roof over there,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14" href="#Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
which I once detected as the top of Jim
Pomeroy's barn, reminded me of the day
of the raisin', when I sprained my ankle
and thereby saved myself a thrashing for
running away. Here was Pickerel Pond,
the scene of many miraculous draughts,
and now I crossed Peach brook which
babbled along under the road just as
saucily and untiringly as if it had slept
all these years and was just awaking
to fresh life. A hundred rods up the
brook was the Widow Parsons's farm, and
I knew that if I went through the side
gate, cut across the barnyard, and kept
down to the left, I should find that same
old stump on which Bill Howland sat
the day he caught the biggest dace ever
pulled out of the quiet pool.</p>

<p>The sun was going down behind Si
Thompson's planing mill as I stopped
at the little red covered bridge that
marked the boundary of the village.
Silas had been dead for twenty years, but
it seemed to me that it was only yester<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15" href="#Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>day
that I heard his nasal twang above
the roar of the machinery: "Sa-ay, you
fellers want to git out o' that!" The
little bridge had lost much of its color
and most of its impressiveness, for I
remembered when to my boyish fancy
it seemed a greater triumph of engineering
than the Victoria bridge at Montreal.
And the same old thrill went through
me as I started to run&mdash;just as I did
when a boy&mdash;and felt the planks loosen
and creak under my feet. Here was a
home-coming worth the while.</p>

<p>Hank Pettigrew kept the village tavern.
The memory of man, so far as I knew,
ran not back to the time when Hank
did not keep the tavern. So I was not
in the least surprised, as I entered, to
see the old man, with his chair tilted
back against the wall, his knees on a
level with his chin, and his eyes fixed
on a chromo of "Muster Day," which
had descended to him through successive
generations. He did not move as I
advanced, or manifest the slightest emo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16" href="#Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>tion
of surprise, merely saying, "Hullo,
Johnny," as if he expected me to remark
that mother had sent me over to see
if he had any ice cream left over from
dinner. It probably did not occur to
Hank that I had been absent twenty-five
years. If it had occurred to him,
he would have considered such a trifling
flight of time not worth mentioning.</p>

<p>With the question of lodging and supper
disposed of, and with the modest bribe of
a cigar, which Hank furtively exchanged
for a more accustomed brand of valley
leaf, it was not difficult to loosen the
old landlord's tongue and secure information
of my playmates. What had
become of Teddy Grover, the pride of
our school on exhibition day? Could
we ever forget the afternoon he stood
up before the minister and the assembled
population and roared "Marco Bozzaris"
until we were sure the sultan was quaking
in his seraglio? And how he thundered
"Blaze with your serried columns,
I will not bend the knee!" To our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17" href="#Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
excited imaginations what dazzling triumphs
the future held out for Teddy.</p>

<p>"Yep; Ted's still a-beout. Three days
in the week he drives stage coach over to
Spicerville, and the rest o' the time he
does odd jobs&mdash;sort o' tendin' round."</p>

<p>And Sallie Cotton&mdash;black-eyed, curly-haired,
mischievous little sprite, the
agony of the teacher and the love and
admiration of the boys! Who climbed
trees, rattled to school in the butcher
wagon, never knew a lesson, but was
always leading lady in the school colloquies,
and was surely destined to rise
to eminence on the American stage if
she did not break her neck tumbling out
of old Skinner's walnut tree?</p>

<p>"Oh, Sal; she married the Congregational
minister down to Peterfield, and
was 'lected president of the Temperance
Union and secretary of the Endeavorers.
Read a piece down at Fust Church last
week on 'Breakin' Away from Old Standards,'
illustratin' the alarmin' degen'racy
of children nowadays."</p>

<p>And George Hawley, our Achilles, our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18" href="#Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
Samson, our ideal of everything manly
and courageous! Strong as an ox and
brave as a lion! Our champion in every
form of athletic sports! Who looked with
contempt on girls and disdained their
maidenly advances! Who thought only
of deeds of muscular prowess, and who
seemed to carry the assurance of a force
that would lead armies and subdue nations!
What of George?</p>

<p>"Wa-al, George was a-beout not long
ago. Had your room for his samples.
Travellin' for a house down in Boston,
and comes here reg'lar. Women folks
say his last line o' shirt waists war the
best they ever see."</p>

<p>Oh, the times that change, and change
us! Alas, the fleeting years, good Posthumus,
that work such havoc with our childhood
dreams and hopes and aspirations!</p>

<p>It was a relief, after the shattering of
these idols, to leave the society of the
communicative Mr. Pettigrew and wander
into the moonlight. Save as adding
beauty to the scenery, the moon was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19" href="#Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
comparatively of no assistance, for so
well was the little village stamped on my
memory, and so little had it changed
in the quarter of a century, that I
could have walked blindfolded to any
suggested point. Naturally I turned my
steps toward the home of my youth,
and as I drew near the old-fashioned,
many-gabled house, with its settled, substantial
air, austere yet inviting, its large
yard with the huge elms, and the big lamp
burning in the library or "sittin'-room,"
where I first dolefully studied the geography
that told me of a world outside, it
seemed to bend toward me rather frigidly
as if to say reproachfully: "You sold me!
you sold me!" True, dear old home;
in my less prosperous days I was guilty of
the crime of selling the house that faithfully
sheltered my family for a hundred
years. But have I not repented? And
have I not returned to buy you back, and
to make such further reparation as present
conditions and true repentance demand?
Is this less the pleasure than the duty of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20" href="#Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
wealth?</p>

<p>With what sensations of delight I walked
softly about the grounds, taking note of
every familiar tree and bush and stump.
I could have sworn that not a twig, not a
blade of grass, had been despoiled or had
disappeared in the years that marked my
absence. I paused reverently under the
old willow tree and affectionately rubbed
my legs, for from this tree my parents had
cut the instruments of torture for purposes
of castigation, and its name, the
weeping willow, was always associated
in my infant mind with the direct results
of contact with my unwilling person. On
a level with the top of the willow was the
little attic room where I slept, and the more
sweetly when the crickets chirped, or the
summer rain beat upon the roof, and where
the song of the birds in the morning is
the happiest music God has given to the
country. Back of the woodshed I found
the remains of an old grindstone, perhaps
the same heavy crank I had so often perspiringly
and reluctantly turned. Indeed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21" href="#Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
my reviving memories were rather too
generously connected with the strenuousness
and not the pleasures of youth, but I
thought of the well-filled lot in the old
burying-ground on the hillside, and of
those lying there who had said: "My
boy, I am doing this for your good." I
doubted it at the time, but perhaps they
were right. At all events the memories
were growing pleasanter, for a stretch of
thirty-five years has many healing qualities,
and our childhood griefs are such little
things in the afterglow.</p>

<p>In the early morning I renewed my rambles,
going first to the little frame school-house,
the old church with its tall spire,
the saw-mill, the deacon's cider press, the
swimming pool, and a dozen other places
of boyish adventure and misadventure.
Your true sentimentalist invariably gives
the preference to scenes over persons, and
is so often rewarded by the fidelity with
which they respond to his eager expectations.
It was not until I had exhausted
every incident of the place that I sought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22" href="#Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
out the companions of my school-days.
What strange irony of fate is that which
sends some of us out into the restless world
to grow away from our old ideals and make
others, and restrains some in the monotonous
rut of village life, to drone peacefully
their little span! But happy he, who,
knowing nothing, misses nothing. If there
were any village Hampdens, or mute, inglorious
Miltons among my playmates, they
gave no present indications. I found the
girls considerably older than I expected,
the boys less interesting than I hoped;
but they all welcomed me with that grave,
unemotional hospitality of the village, and
we talked, far into the shadows, of our
schooltime, the day that is never dead
while memory endures.</p>

<p>And so it came about that at the close
of day I found myself standing at the
garden gate of the Eastmann cottage.
Peleg Eastmann had been our village postmaster,
a grave, shy man, who had received
the federal office because the thrifty
neighbors agreed, irrespective of political<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23" href="#Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
feeling, that it was much less expensive to
give him the office than to support him
and his two daughters, the prettiest girls
in our school. For they further agreed
that Peleg was a "shif'less sort o' critter"
and never could make a living, though
he was a model postmaster and an excellent
citizen and neighbor. Hence, when
it came Peleg's turn to make the journey
to the burying-ground in the village hearse,
the whole community of Meadowvale was
scandalized by the discovery that he had
left his girls a comfortable little fortune,
enough to keep them in modest wealth.
Meadowvale never recovered from this
shock. It felt that it had been victimized,
and that its tenderest sensibility had
been violated, and when his disconsolate
daughters put up the granite shaft to their
father's memory, relating that he had
been faithful and just, the indignant political
leader of the village remarked that it
was "profanation of Scriptur'."</p>

<p>Thirty years ago I had stood at this
little gate with one of the Eastmann<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24" href="#Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
girls, escorting her home from Stella Perkins's
party. I had attempted to kiss her
good-night, and she had boxed my ears,
thus contributing a disagreeable finale to
an otherwise pleasant evening. Time is a
great healer and I cherished no resentment
at this late day toward the repudiator
of my caresses. In fact I smiled in recollection
of the incident as I walked up the
gravelled path and knocked at the door.
I wondered if the same vivacious, rosy-cheeked
girl would come to meet me, and
if I should feel in duty bound to make
honorable amends. The door was opened
by a tall, spare woman, who carried a
lamp. The light reflected directly on
her features, showed a face that in any
other part of the world would be called
hard; in New England it is merely resolute.
It was the face of a woman fifty
years of age, with massive chin, slightly
sunken cheeks, a prominent nose, heavy
eyebrows, and a high forehead rather
scantily streaked by gray hair. There
was no trace of the girlish bloom I had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25" href="#Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
known, of the beauty that once had been
hers, but the imperious manner of the
woman was unmistakable.</p>

<p>"Mary," I began jocularly, "I have
come to apologize."</p>

<p>She thrust the lamp forward, peered
into my face, and said, with not the faintest
trace of a smile or the slightest evidence
of embarrassment:</p>

<p>"Why, that's all right, Johnny Stanhope.
I accept your apology. Come
right in."</p>

<p>I went in. We sat in the sitting-room
and talked of our school-days and our
fortunes. I told her how I had gone
down to the city, how I had prospered,
of my adventures in the world, of my
marriage&mdash;dealing very gently with my
relations with the late Mrs. Stanhope&mdash;of
my bereavement and present idyllic
existence. And she told me of herself,
how she had lived on and on in the little
cottage, caring only for the support and
education of her niece, Phyllis Kinglake,
an orphan for nearly twenty years. "You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26" href="#Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
remember Sylvia?" she said, with the first
touch of emotion.</p>

<p>Did I remember Sylvia? My little
fair-haired playmate with the large eyes
and the blue veins showing through the
delicate beauty of her face? Little Sylvia,
who first won my boyish affection, and
with whom I made a solemn contract of
marriage when we were only seven years
old? Did I not remember how I would
pass her house on my way to school, and
stand at the gate and whistle until she
came shyly out, with her face as red as
her little hood and tippet, and give me
her books to carry, and protest with the
ever present coquetry of girlhood that
she thought I had gone long ago? Could
I ever forget how I saved my coppers,
one by one, until I had accumulated a
sum large enough to buy a whole cocoanut,
which I presented to her in the
proudest moment of my life, and how the
other girls tossed their heads with the affectation
of a sneer, and with pretended
indifference to this astonishing stroke of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27" href="#Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
fortune? And that fatal evening when
I provoked my little beauty's wrath,
and in all the receding opportunities of
"Post-Office" and "Copenhagen" she
had turned her face and rosy lips away
from me, until the world was black with
a hopeless despair? And the singing-school
where she was our shining ornament,
and that blissful night when I
stood up with her in the village church,
while we sang our duet descriptive of the
special virtues of some particular flower
nominated in the cantata? And how,
growing older and shyer, we still preserved
our youthful fancy even to the
day I struck out into the world, both
believing in the endurance of the tie that
would draw me back? What caprice of
fate is it that dispels the illusions of youth
and restores them tenfold in the reflection
of after years and over the gulf of
the grave? Did I remember Sylvia?</p>

<p>Then Mary went on to tell me of
Sylvia's happy marriage to George Kinglake,
how, when little Phyllis had come,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28" href="#Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
and the world was at its brightest, the
parents had been stricken down in the
same week by a virulent disease, and
how, with her dying breath, the mother
had asked her sister to look after her
little one and protect her from sorrow
and harm. Very simply this stern-featured
woman told the story of her efforts to
do her duty to her sister's child, and it
seemed to me that her face grew softer
and her voice gentler as she went over
the years they had grown older together,
while the beauty of this woman's life
was glorified by the willing sacrifices of
imposed motherhood. I could not see
Phyllis, for she was spending the night
with friends in another part of the village.
Next time, she hoped, I might be more
successful.</p>

<p>Walking slowly to the tavern my mind
still went back to my little playmate and
the golden days of youth, and if my
heart grew a little tenderer, and my eyes
were moistened by the recall, what need
to be ashamed of the emotion? And if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29" href="#Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
in the night I dreamed that I was a boy
again, and that a fair-haired child played
with me in the changing glow of dreamland
in the best and purest scenes of the
human comedy, was it a delusion to be
dispelled, a memory to be put aside?
Did I remember Sylvia?</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30" href="#Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span style="margin-left: -.7em;"><b>HE</b></span> thought that my train was to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31" href="#Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
leave at ten o'clock did not
depress me as I awoke, with the
sunlight streaming through the window,
for, after all, I was obliged to admit that the
monotony of Meadowvale and the sluggishness
of my village friends were beginning
to have an appreciable effect. Then
the memory of little Sylvia came to me
again, and nothing seemed pleasanter, as
a benediction to the old days, than a
visit to the burying-ground where she
was sleeping. The previous day I had
paid the obligations of remembrance and
respect to the graves of my kindred, and
it gave me at first an uncomfortable feeling
to realize that the thought of them
was less potent than the recollection of
this young girl. But was it strange or
inexcusable? Had they not lived out
their lives of honored usefulness, and
grown old and weary of the battle? And
had not she passed away just as the
greater joys of living were unfolding,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32" href="#Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
and the assurance of happiness was the
stronger? Poor Sylvia!</p>

<p>The spectacle of a correctly dressed,
middle-aged man passing down the street,
bearing a somewhat cumbersome burden
of lilies-of-the-valley and forget-me-nots,
must have had its peculiar significance
to the inhabitants of the village, and
many curious glances were my reward.
I passed along, however, without explanations
in distinct violation of rural
etiquette. The old caretaker of the
burying-ground met me at the entrance
and gave me the directions&mdash;second
path to the right, half way up the hill,
just to the left of the big elm. The old
man had known me as a boy and would
have detained me in conversation, but
I pleaded that my time was short, and
reluctantly he let me go my way. Slowly
up the hill I walked, occasionally pausing
to place a forget-me-not on the grave
of one I had known in childhood. Even
old Barrows did not escape my passing
tribute&mdash;a cynical, cross-grained old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33" href="#Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
fellow, the aversion of the boys, who
tormented him and whom he tormented
with reciprocal vigor. No need of a
forget-me-not for Barrows, for he never
forgot anything, so I gave his somewhat
neglected grave the token of a long stem
of little lilies, in evidence that the past
was forgiven, and moved on to avoid
possible protestation.</p>

<p>I paused under the wide-branching elm
to recover my breath. The assent had
been arduous for a gentleman inclined
to portliness and with wind impaired by
tobacco. I turned to the left, and at
that moment, just before me, a woman's
figure slowly rose from the ground. A
creeping sensation possessed me. My
heart bounded and my pulses thrilled.
Was this Sylvia risen from the dead?
Surely it was Sylvia's graceful girlish
form! This was Sylvia's oval face, with
Sylvia's large gray eyes. In such a way
Sylvia's pretty light hair waved about
her temples, and the pink and white
of her delicate complexion revealed the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34" href="#Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
blue veins. Twenty-five years had rolled
back in an instant, and I was standing in
the presence of the past. Alas, the swift
passing of the illusion, for the conversation
of the evening came to me.</p>

<p>"You are Phyllis?" I said.</p>

<p>"I am Phyllis," she answered softly&mdash;her
mother's voice&mdash;"and you are
Mr. Stanhope. My aunt told me."</p>

<p>I did not answer, for I was staring
stupidly at her, reluctant to abandon
the pleasing fancy that my thinking
of her had brought her back from the
dead again. She did not speak, but
glanced inquiringly at the flowers I held
in my hand.</p>

<p>"I knew your mother, Phyllis," I
managed to say. "She was a very dear
playmate of my childhood. I have
brought these flowers to put upon her
grave. Shall we go together?"</p>

<p>The girl's eyes filled, and she pointed
to the rising mound at her feet. Silently
we bent over and reverently laid the
lilies and forget-me-nots under the simple<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35" href="#Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
headstone.</p>

<p>"May I talk to you of your mother?"
I asked.</p>

<p>We sat down on a rude bench in the
path, and I told her of my childhood, of
the days when Sylvia and I were sweethearts,
of our little quarrels and frolics,
of her mother's beauty and gentleness.
The girl laughed at the recital of our
misadventures, and the tears came into
her eyes when I touched on my boyish
affection for my playmate. Then she
told me of her own life, so peaceful and
happy in the little village, and in the
neighboring town, where she had been
educated with all the care and diligence
of the New England impulse. I looked
at my watch.</p>

<p>"It is quarter past eleven," I said ruefully,
"and my train left at ten."</p>

<p>"There's another train at three," she
replied. "You will go home and dine
with us? We dine at twelve in the country,
you know."</p>

<p>If I was somewhat ashamed to face<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36" href="#Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
Mary Eastmann, she received us with the
same stolidity she had manifested when
we first met, and at once insisted that I
should remain for dinner. "Go into the
parlor," she said abruptly.</p>

<p>Phyllis plucked the sleeve of my coat.
"Don't go in there," she whispered;
"that's Aunt Mary's room exclusively,
and I'm afraid you'll not find it very
cheerful. Come out on the porch."</p>

<p>"I know the room," I whispered back,
as we went out together. "At least I
know the type. Lots of horse-hair belongings.
Square piano against the wall.
Wax flowers under a glass case on the
mantel. Steel engravings of Washington
crossing the Delaware. Family album,
huge Bible, and 'Famous Women of Two
Centuries' on the centre table. Seashells,
blue wedgwood and German china things
mingled in delightful confusion on the
what-not. If not wax flowers, it's wax
fruit."</p>

<p>Phyllis laughed&mdash;how much her laugh
was like her mother's&mdash;and nodded her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37" href="#Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
head. "Not a bad description," she assented;
"you must have the gift of second
sight."</p>

<p>"Not second sight. Suppose we call it
the gift of second childhood."</p>

<p>We sat on the porch and looked down
on the lawn that sloped to the orchard,
and watched the robins run across
the grass. And I pointed out to
Phyllis the very tree under which Sylvia
and I had stood the day we had our first
memorable quarrel, confessing that while
at the time there was no doubt in my
mind that Sylvia was clearly at fault, I was
now prepared to concede, after plenty of
reflection, that possibly she might have
had a reasonable defence. The recital of
this pathetic incident led to other reminiscences
connected with the old house and
its grounds, and I was hardly in the
second chapter when Mary came out and
ordered us in to dinner. Mary never invited,
never requested; she merely ordered.
We sat at the table, and at a severe look
from Mary I stopped fumbling with my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38" href="#Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
napkin, while Phyllis&mdash;sweet saint!&mdash;folded
her hands and asked the divine
blessing. Pagan philosopher that
I was, I was singularly moved by the
simple faith of these two women, and I
think that when I am led back into the
fold of my family creed, a girl as young
and fair and holy as Phyllis will be the
angel to guide me.</p>

<p>The dinner was toothsome, the environment
fascinating, the afternoon perfect,
and so it came about quite naturally that
I missed the three-o'clock train. "There is
nothing so disagreeable in life," I explained
apologetically to my friends, "as a hard
and fast schedule, which keeps one jumping
like an electric clock, doing sixty
things every hour and never varying the
performance. Fortunately trains run every
day except Sunday, and the general order
of the universe is not going to be upset
because I am not checking myself off like
a section-hand."</p>

<p>Perhaps Mary did not wholly coincide
with my argument, but she was called<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39" href="#Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
away to her sewing-circle, while Phyllis
and I lounged lazily on the porch, I continuing
my reminiscences. Garrulity is
not merely the prerogative of age; the
privilege of the monologue is always that
of the old boy who comes back to his
childhood's home and finds in a pretty
girl a charming and attentive listener. He
is a poor orator, indeed, who cannot improve
such opportunities. At a convenient
lull in the flow of discourse we went
off to ride, exploring the country roads
I knew so well, and here began new
matter and new reminiscences, patiently
endured by Phyllis, who was a most delightful
girl. And when we returned
late in the afternoon it was directly in the
line of circumstances that I should remain
for tea; and after tea Phyllis played and
sang for me in the little parlor, for Phyllis
was a musician of no small merit. When
in reply to my inquiry she sang a simple
Scotch ballad her mother had sung so
touchingly many years before, a great
lump rose in my throat, and I sat far over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40" href="#Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
in the shadow that she and Mary might
not see how blurred were my eyes, and
how unmanageable my emotion. At what
age does it come to a man and a philosopher
that he is no longer ashamed of
honest, sympathetic tears?</p>

<p>I shall never know whether it was the
journey in the train, the air and cooking
of Meadowvale, or the visits to the burying-ground,
that upset me, but for the
first time in a dozen years I found myself
dissatisfied with my home. I remarked
to Malachy that the roses seemed to be
in a most discouraging condition, and
that the garden in general was altogether
disappointing. I noticed that my dogs
barked a great deal, that the neighbors
had become most tiresome, and that
Bunsey was an unmitigated nuisance.
Even the cuisine, which had been my
pride and boast, grew at times unbearable,
and I had not been home a fortnight
before I astonished Prudence by
positively assuring her that the dinner
she had set before me was not worth any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41" href="#Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
sane man's serious attention. Whereupon
that excellent woman announced
with superb pride that she "guessed it
was about time for that Rogers woman
to give another card-party."</p>

<p>"Prudence," I said severely, for I
encourage no flippancy on the part of
domestics, "that remark, while probably
hasty and ill-considered, borders on impertinence.
I shall overlook it this time
on account of your faithful services in
the past. But don't let it happen again.
In any event," I amended considerately,
"don't let it drop in my presence."</p>

<p>Thinking it over I came to the conclusion
that Prudence was right in the
general effect of the suggestion. What I
needed was a change of scene. Long
abstention from travel and variety of
incident had made me restless and discontented.
I had not been in Europe for
two years. Undoubtedly I was pining
for a lazy tour of the Continent. The
thought decided me. I should book my
passage on the steamer that sailed the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42" href="#Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
Saturday of the following week.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, at this interesting
moment, I received a letter from the
chairman of the committee on public improvements
in the village of Meadowvale,
announcing that it had been resolved to
procure new rooms for the village library,
and would Mr. John Stanhope do his
native village the honor of subscribing a
small amount toward this desirable end.
As it is always much easier for an indolent
man to telegraph than to write letters,
I replied by wire that Mr. Stanhope
felt himself much honored by the request.
Not entirely satisfied with this confession,
I sent a second telegram an hour
later doubling my subscription. Still
my conscience troubled me.</p>

<p>"I have not done my duty," I said to
myself. "Here I am, a man of means,
I may say of large wealth, with no special
obligations resting upon me, and yet I
have done nothing to benefit or enrich
my old home. It is strange that it has
not occurred to me before what a privilege,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43" href="#Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
what an honor, it is to be a philanthropist
even in a small way, and with
what alacrity those whom Heaven has
blessed with a fortune should respond to
the calls of deserving need. I blush for
my past thoughtlessness, and I shall
hasten to atone for my astonishing neglect.
My duty lies before me, and I
shall not shrink from it, whatever the
personal inconvenience."</p>

<p>Thereupon I telegraphed for the third
time to the chairman that it would give
Mr. Stanhope the greatest pleasure to
put up a suitable library for the village
of Meadowvale, and, in order to guard
against any possible misunderstanding,
he would depart the following day to
confer with the committee as to site and
probable extent of the structure. This
concession to my conscience comforted
me greatly, and I prepared for my journey
with a lightness that was almost
buoyancy. The chairman and two of
the committee met me at the junction.
They were most deprecatory and apologetic,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44" href="#Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
and mentioned with evident sorrow
the absence of several of the members
which might cause a postponement of
the conference until the following day.
I bore up under this intelligence with
astonishing cheerfulness.</p>

<p>"My good friends," I said, "don't let
this disturb you for a minute. I am not
so pressed for time that I cannot wait
on your reasonable convenience. Your
tavern is well kept and the food is wholesome.
I think I may say that my old
friends in Meadowvale will interest me
until we can come to an amicable understanding.
Suppose, to be sure of a full
meeting, that we fix the time of conference
at day after to-morrow&mdash;a little late
in the afternoon."</p>

<p>After this suggestion had been received
with suitable expressions of gratitude, we
journeyed together to the village, where
I was duly turned over to old Pettigrew.
And then, as the day was by no means
done, I strolled down the street and,
most naturally and quite unthinkingly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45" href="#Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
found myself a few minutes later looking
over the Eastmann gate at Phyllis on the
porch. To say that this charming girl
was surprised by my sudden appearance
was no less true than to admit that she
did not seem in the least displeased.
I positively had no intention of going
in, but before I knew it I was sitting
beside her, relating in the most casual
way the reason of my coming.</p>

<p>"How good it was of you," said the
ingenuous creature, "and how delighted
and grateful Meadowvale will be. It
must be glorious to be rich enough to
do things for other people."</p>

<p>Now it is not a disagreeable sensation
to feel that one is rich and good and
glorious in the large gray eyes of a very
pretty woman, and I was conscious of
the mild intoxication from the compliment.
"It is, indeed," I answered magnanimously.
"I have always maintained
that money is given to us in trust for
those around us, and that in making
others happy we find our greatest happiness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46" href="#Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
I regret that I have not wholly
lived up to this undeniably correct
principle."</p>

<p>"It will require at least a thousand
dollars," she said na&iuml;vely.</p>

<p>"Oh, at least."</p>

<p>She was silent a moment. Then she
said: "I was wondering what I would
do if I had a thousand dollars to give
away."</p>

<p>"What do you think you would do?"</p>

<p>"Speaking for my own preferences I
think I should like to establish a country
club."</p>

<p>"The very thing. If there is one crying
want more than another in Meadowvale
it is a country club, with golf links,
tennis courts, and shower baths."</p>

<p>"Now you are laughing at me."</p>

<p>"Not at all. Fancy old Hank and
you playing a foursome with Aunt Mary
and me for the cider and apples. Why,
it would add years of robustness to our
waning lives."</p>

<p>"No," said the girl decisively. "It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47" href="#Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
isn't feasible."</p>

<p>"Then," I went on musingly, "we
might have an Art Institute, or the
Phyllis Kinglake School of Expression,
or the Meadowvale Woman's Club, or
the Colonial Dames, or, best of all, the
Daughters of the American Revolution."</p>

<p>"That shows how little you appreciate
the local situation," she responded quickly,
"for your best of all is worse and worse.
Imagine an order of Daughters in a place
where every woman's ancestors did nothing
but fight in the Revolution. As
well call a town meeting at once. Ah,"&mdash;with
a sigh&mdash;"I see that I shall
never spend the thousand dollars in
Meadowvale."</p>

<p>"Don't be too sure of that, my dear
Phyllis," I exclaimed in an outburst, for
I was in a particularly happy and generous
mood; "and remember that when
you do decide how the money is to be
philanthropically invested we shall see
that it is forthcoming."</p>

<p>With such agreeable banter the minutes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48" href="#Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
slipped away, and when Mary appeared
with the customary invitation to tea, it
would have been a jolt to the harmonious
order of things to decline. I cannot say
that I have ever cordially approved the
austerity of the New England tea-table,
with its cold bread and biscuits, its applesauce,
its frugal allowance of sardines,
its basket of cake, and its not very stimulating
pot of tea. But such are the compensations
of pleasant society that even
these chilly viands may be forgotten, and
I said my "Amen" to Phyllis's sweet and
modest grace with all the heartiness of a
thankful man. As no gentleman may, with
propriety, run away immediately after he
has accepted hospitality, I lingered in the
evening, and we had more music, which
so calmed and rested me that I wondered
at my past nervousness and marvelled that
I had even contemplated a journey across
the water.</p>

<p>How it came about that the next morning
Phyllis and I were strolling over the
village, down by the river and into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49" href="#Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
pleasant woods, I have forgotten, but
I dare say that we were discussing
further developments of philanthropy,
and endeavoring to come to a conclusion
as to the proper disposition
of that troublesome thousand dollars.
The girl was so young and joyous, so
pretty, so arch, so fascinating with that
little coquettishness that is not the usual
type of the Puritan maiden, I could not
find it in my heart to remember Mary's
words and "try to instil in her a closer
appreciation of the more serious purposes
of life." Indeed life is so serious
that it is one of the blessed decrees of
Mother Nature that we have that brief
allotment of time when it is too serious
to think about, and youth passes so
quickly that it is criminal to rob it of its
golden hour. In such a presence I felt
my own spirits rising, my step becoming
springy, my whole nature less sluggish,
and, had I looked in the mirror, I should
have confidently expected to see a youthful
bloom in my cheeks and a return of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50" href="#Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
hair to primary conditions.</p>

<p>It is due to this interesting young
woman to say that she coyly urged me
not to forget my other friends, since I
was to leave so soon, and it pleased me
to fancy that she was not altogether offended
when I spoke somewhat hastily
and rather flippantly of those of my former
companions who had lapsed into
tediousness. I reminded her also that
as the happiest memory of my childhood
was associated with her mother, so it was
sweet to me to be with her and live again,
in a pleasant dream, the brightness of the
past. Then, for her mother's sake, she
shyly let me take her hand while I went
over again, not without emotion, the
story of my early love. Dear little Sylvia!</p>

<p>The meeting of the committee was followed
by a general congregation of citizens,
and I was invited to the platform,
where I outlined my plans. I hinted
that the library was merely the beginning
of a number of beneficences which I desired
to contribute to Meadowvale's prosperity,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51" href="#Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
and as I looked down upon my
listeners and caught sight of Phyllis,
glancing up with flushed cheeks and sparkling
eyes, I was nearly betrayed into promises
of the most preposterous nature. At
the end of my remarks&mdash;I recall that I
spoke with unusual grace and eloquence&mdash;the
chairman stood up and gravely
thanked me, intimating that I was a credit
to Meadowvale and its perfect public
school system. I fancy I should have
been applauded if it had been compatible
with the nature of the people of
Meadowvale to make so riotous a demonstration.
At the close of the meeting it
happened, by the purest accident, that I
walked home with Mary and Phyllis,
and when Mary said in her blunt way
that I really had been most generous,
Phyllis did not speak, but she
slipped her hand under my arm and gave
me an appreciative little squeeze, which
made me regret that I had not pledged
another thousand.</p>

<p>I was to leave the next morning, thanks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52" href="#Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
to the officious members of the committee,
who had so blunderingly hurried
matters to accommodate me that I had no
longer an excuse of remaining. And it
was for this reason that I went in and sat
again in the little parlor, while Phyllis sang
for me the songs that were my favorites,
and some her mother sang in the long
ago. Memories were again pleasantly
stirred within me, as was not infrequent
in those days, and I experienced all the
happiness that comes to him who is persuaded
that he has made himself a little
above the ordinary attractions of the
earth. In this excess of good feeling,
and stimulated alike by the music and
the consciousness of a philanthropic impulse,
I waited until the moment of parting
before declaring definitely my excellent
intentions.</p>

<p>"My dear Mary," I began, turning to
that admirable spinster, "you know how
our childhood was linked by a close family
feeling, and how you and Sylvia and I
planned in our simple ambitions to live<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53" href="#Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
together in the great world outside. We
may say now that this was childish romance,
and that the caprice of time has
made it an idle fancy. For many years
we have been separated, and only by a
happy chance have we been brought together.
Fortune has been kind to me.
I am called a rich man, and I believe I
may say without boasting that I am far
beyond the need of anxiety. But to a
degree I am a lonely man. My sister's
child is my one near relative in the world,
and he is a young man with an excellent
business, able to take care of himself,
and naturally engrossed with his own
occupations. You can understand that
at my time of life, alone as I am, and
still young enough to appreciate the joys
of living, I have a feeling of desolation
for which no riches can compensate.
Had fortune given me a daughter, like
our Phyllis here, I think no happiness
could have been so great. It has pleased
me to look back upon the past, to recall
the days of our childhood, and to see in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54" href="#Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
Phyllis the image of her mother. Why
can I not link the present and the future
with the past? Why can I not look on
Phyllis as my own daughter, and give to
her all the father love I have learned to
feel? I do not rob you either of her love
or her presence. I merely add a new
joy to my life, and know that in caring
for you both and in contributing to her
happiness, and securing her against misfortune
after we are taken away, I am
carrying out the pledge, however idle at
the time, I made to Sylvia."</p>

<p>I fancied I saw what may have been
the suspicion of a tear in Mary Eastmann's
eye. It vanished as quickly as it
came, and when she spoke and thanked
me for my generous offer, her voice was
as calm and her manner as collected as
if I had made a casual suggestion for
attendance at a prayer meeting. She could
not deny that the opportunity was too
enticing to be ignored, and she admitted
that my fatherly proposition was distinctly
advantageous. Her New England<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55" href="#Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
independence rather revolted at the
thought of any immediate financial assistance,
which was not needed, while her
New England thrift approved a future
settlement based on family friendliness
of many years' standing. On the whole
she was inclined to be favorable to my
point of view.</p>

<p>As for Phyllis, she had listened to me
with undisguised amazement. Her big
gray eyes had grown larger, and the
color left her cheeks as I finished. Then
the rosy red rushed back, her lip quivered
and the tears sprang to her eyes. A
moment later she smiled, then laughed,
and was serious again. How incomprehensible
are these young girls! Poor
child! she had never known a father's
love.</p>

<p>Phyllis followed me to the door. The
light, streaming from the parlor, shone
squarely on her exquisite face. A thrill
of pleasure went through me as I realized
that at last I had a daughter whom I
could love and cherish. I took her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56" href="#Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
hand in both of mine, and, as I released
it, I parted the light, wavy hair, and
kissed her forehead. It seemed to me
that she trembled slightly, but in a
moment she was herself, and a gleam
of merriment was in her eyes, as she
said:</p>

<p>"Of course you will write to me&mdash;papa?"</p>

<p>Doubtless the novelty of the situation
made me just a little embarrassed. To
be called "papa" the first time by a
pretty girl was more embarrassing than
I had expected. And why that half-laugh
in her eye, and why that almost
quizzical tone? Was I not kind and
good enough to be her father, and had I
not tried to show her every paternal consideration?
Was I not honestly endeavoring
to fulfil a sacred pledge? I
was perplexed but not discouraged. "I
will prove to her," I said to myself with
firmness, "that I am entirely worthy of
her filial affection, and that she may lean
confidently upon me." And I went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57" href="#Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
straightway to bed, and dreamed of her
all night as every true father should
dream of the daughter of his heart and
his hope.</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58" href="#Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="dropcapn">I</span><span style="margin-left: -.7em;"><b>N</b></span> the very nature of things it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59" href="#Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
necessary that I should return frequently
to Meadowvale, to confer
with the village committee and make all
proper arrangements for beginning so
important a local enterprise. While this
put an end to my projected trip to
Europe I accepted the situation with
calmness and forbearance, satisfied that
in the pursuit of duty and in giving
happiness to my fellow creatures I should
have the reward of an approving conscience.
To my nephew, Frederick Grinnell,
I gave the task of preparing the
plans, and his excellent suggestions were
cordially adopted. Much of my spare
time&mdash;and it is amazing how much spare
time one has in a village&mdash;was spent
at the Eastmann cottage with my new
daughter, and in the evening I talked
to her of the world outside, quite, I
fancy, as Othello may have spoken to
Desdemona, but with a more conservative
and a better impulse. I unfolded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60" href="#Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
to her the wonders of great London, the
pleasures of Paris, the beauties of Venice,
the sacred mysteries of Rome, the noble
traditions of Athens. I journeyed with
her up the Nile and down the Rhine.
One night we were in gay Vienna,
another in Berlin, a third in the grandeur
of the Alhambra. From the fjords of
Norway to the tea houses of Japan was
the journey of a few minutes, and the
indifference of my surfeited life gave
way before the kindling enthusiasm of
this lovely country girl, whose world had
been the area of scarcely more than a
township.</p>

<p>But the paternal relation, however
honest and commendable my intentions,
did not seem to thrive as I had fondly
hoped. Only in her teasing moments
would this vivacious creature admit the
solemnity of our compact, and when she
called me "papa" there was always that
gleam of the eye, with that merriment
of tone, which may not have been disrespectful
but was certainly not filial.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61" href="#Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
This troubled me exceedingly. I thought
it all over and one night I said to her:</p>

<p>"My dear Phyllis, it has become only
too evident that you do not entertain
that deferential feeling for me which a
daughter should have for a father. I
shall not describe your emotions as I
have analyzed them, but I am satisfied
that we shall not make a complete success
of my long cherished plan. However, I
am not prepared to withdraw unreservedly
from my schemes for your comfort and
happiness, and since you cannot look upon
me as a father, or treat me like a father,
I have another suggestion to offer. Let
me be your elder brother, and watch over
and guard you as a brother's duty should
direct. There shall be no diminution of
my love, no retraction of my promises.
Perhaps, in the feeling that I am your
brother, you will talk with me with greater
frankness, and feel more closely drawn to
me, and we shall be all the better and the
happier for the change."</p>

<p>Thus speaking I took her pretty hand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62" href="#Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
and carried it respectfully to my lips,
at the same time patting it affectionately
and assuring her of my brotherly devotion.
And this incomprehensible girl threw back
her head and laughed; then burst into
tears, laughed again, flushed to crimson
and ran out of the room. I was grieved
beyond measure. Had I done wrong so
quickly and rudely to sever a connection
so holy? Had the filial feeling been suddenly
awakened in her breast? Was I
depriving this poor child of a tender
paternal care, for which she longed, but
which maidenly coyness could not immediately
accept?</p>

<p>As a philosopher I have made woman
the subject of much research, and my
library bears witness to the attention I
have paid to the written opinions of the
ablest writers and thinkers of all times,
who have had anything to do with this
fascinating theme. I have seen her in all
her phases, analyzed her in all her emotions,
and Bunsey has admitted to me
that my theoretical knowledge has been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63" href="#Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
of great value to him in dealing subtly
with his heroines. And yet, despite my
complete equipment in mental construction,
I am constantly surprised by a
new development, a sudden and unaccountable
phenomenon of feminine nature,
which undoubtedly escaped the
experience and reasoning of the experts
and sages. It is indeed a matter of pride
in woman that while man has studied her
for thousands of years, she continues to
exhibit fresh delights in her infinite variety
of moods and to put forth unexpectedly
new and astounding shoots.</p>

<p>I saw Phyllis no more that evening,
save in my dreams, and it was wholly
creditable to the goodness of my motives
and the sincerity of my affection that she
abided with me in my slumbering fancies
with no protracted intermissions. The
next day she was as sweet and gracious as
ever, but I thought her tone a little constrained,
and when, as a father or brother
should, I ventured to speak of the tenderness
of our family relation, a half-imploring
look came into her beautiful eyes. And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64" href="#Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
when I casually remarked on the softness
of her hair, or the slenderness of her fingers,
her glance was timidly reproachful.
All this gave me great unhappiness, and I
discovered, to my further distress, that in
my attempt to return to the old familiar
footing I was neglecting the committee and
losing interest in the affairs of the library.
A certain peevishness took possession of
me; I was no longer myself, and I lost
the gayety and sprightliness which had
been always my distinguishing virtues.</p>

<p>Furthermore I missed the companionship
and solace of my books in this emergency,
for I had no reference library to
which I could go in Meadowvale for aid
in establishing the true condition of this
strange girl. I recalled dimly that somewhere
on my shelves was a volume which
contained a fairly analogous case, but while
I knew that I possessed such a book I
could not remember the circumstances or
the incidents cited, and this added to my
unrest. Only a student can understand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65" href="#Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
the absolute wretchedness which overtakes
a man when he finds himself miserably
dependent on a distant library. For several
days I gave myself up entirely to my
mental depression, greatly wondering at
the perplexing change in my life, and
marvelling that in all my explorations in
philosophy I had not provided for just
such a crisis, whatever it might be. One
afternoon as I sat in my room at the
tavern, looking idly out of the window
and across the little river which rippled
by, something seemed to strike me violently
in the forehead. It may have been
a telepathic suggestion, it may have been a
return to consciousness; at all events it was
an idea. I leaped from my chair, put on
my hat, and proceeded rather feverishly to
the Eastmann cottage. Phyllis was away
for the day; Mary was knitting in the
sitting-room. I watched her in silence for
a moment, and then I said abruptly:</p>

<p>"Mary, I think I should like to marry
Phyllis."</p>

<p>Mary Eastmann was not the type of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66" href="#Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
woman to lose herself or betray astonishment.
She pushed her spectacles sharply
above her eyes, looked at me sternly, and
said in a rasping voice.</p>

<p>"John Stanhope, don't be an old fool."</p>

<p>"Whatever I may be, Mary," I answered,
much nettled by her tone, "I do
not think anybody can properly regard me
as a fool. As for the other qualification," I
went on complacently, "I am not so old."</p>

<p>"You and Sylvia were the same age,
and she would have been forty-eight."</p>

<p>"A man is as old as he feels," I ventured,
finding refuge in a proverb.</p>

<p>"That is evasive, and has nothing to do
with the question. Beside, what reason
have you to believe that Phyllis has the
slightest desire to marry you?"</p>

<p>"Frankly, not the slightest reason in
the world," I replied with the utmost
candor. "That is why I have been so
bold as to speak to you on the subject."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you thought I might use my
influence to help you along?"</p>

<p>"Quite the contrary, my dear Mary, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67" href="#Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
assure you. I may not know very much
about women"&mdash;I was quite humble when
separated from my library&mdash;"but I do
know that nothing is so fatal to a lover's
prospects as the encouragement of the
loved one's relations. You see that I am
perfectly frank."</p>

<p>"Then you wish my opposition?"</p>

<p>"Come, let us be reasonable. I have
told you I wish to marry Phyllis. I know
my good points, and I am not unacquainted
with my weak ones. Unhappily I can
figure out my age to a day. Alas, I am
forty-eight, and Phyllis is not yet twenty-three.
The difference is positively ghastly
from a sentimental standpoint, but if I
love her, and she is not hopelessly indifferent
to me, I think that even that difficulty
can be bridged. You know my
position, my character, my general reputation.
Neither of us knows what Phyllis
really thinks or what she will say or do in
the matter. I do not ask either for your
opposition or your good offices. I have
come to you as an old friend and the girl's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68" href="#Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
nearest relative to tell you exactly how I
feel and what I wish to gain. And I ask
only that I may have the same chance to
win her affection that you might grant to a
younger man."</p>

<p>Mary's voice was gentler when she
spoke again. "John," she said, "Phyllis
is all I have in the world. It is my
one idea to have her happily married to
a worthy man whom she honestly loves.
Providence, in inscrutable wisdom, may
have decreed that you are that man, but,"
she continued with a sudden return of
Yankee caution, "I have my doubts, considering
your age. However, you have
acted honorably in coming to me, and
while I think Phyllis would be a better
daughter than wife to you, I cannot speak
for her. Remember that she is very young
and very inexperienced. Her acquaintance
with men has been slight. You are
a man of the world and with enough of
the surface polish&mdash;I don't say it stops
with that&mdash;to dazzle any girl accustomed
to such surroundings as we have here.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69" href="#Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
Undoubtedly an offer from you would flatter
her; it might induce her to accept you,
thinking that she loved you. Be careful.
Be sure of your ground before it is too
late."</p>

<p>As I walked back to the village I
mused on what Mary had said, but I felt
no apprehension. Most lovers are alike
in this&mdash;in youth, in middle age, in senility.
Perhaps the advantage of middle
life is that a man is more the master of
himself, more in possession of the faculties
necessary to carry him through a crisis.
Without the impetuous desire of youth, or
the deadened sensibilities of old age, he
has a certain serene confidence that is a
mixture of love and philosophy. It disturbed
me somewhat to find with what
equanimity I faced a situation which promised
nothing. It really annoyed me to
note that I was picking out mentally the
place to which I should conduct Phyllis
in order to have the harmonious environment
adapted to a sentimental proposition.
I remembered that down by the river,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70" href="#Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
just beyond the willows, there was an old
tree where Sylvia and I&mdash;ah, so many
years ago!&mdash;had sat and talked of our
lives before us. To that sacred spot I
would lead Sylvia's daughter, and, passing
gently from the past to the present, I
would tell her of my love and of my fondest
hopes. How dignified and appropriate
such a spot for a frank, calm, and self-contained
avowal!</p>

<p>Thus philosophically and amiably plotting
I walked contentedly along, and, looking
up, I saw Phyllis coming toward me,
swinging her hat in her hand, and suggesting
in her girlish beauty and graceful outline
the poet's shepherdess. She did not
see me, and, yielding to a sudden impulse,
I stepped quickly aside in the shadow of
a neighbor's house, as she passed on with
her eyes on the ground. I followed at a little
distance, and discovered, much to my dismay,
that she chose the road that led to the
burying-ground. Now a cemetery is not
at all the spot that a man, whatever his
philosophy, would select for a tender<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71" href="#Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
declaration, but I was buoyed by the remembrance
of Mary's words. "The finger
of Providence may be in it," I muttered.
"The Lord's will be done."</p>

<p>Slowly up the winding path she walked,
and I as slowly followed. When I reached
her, she was standing at her mother's
grave, just as she had stood the morning
we first met. I tried to accept this as an
omen, but failed miserably, and omens,
after all, depend on the point of view.
She raised her eyes, and, seeing me,
blushed, another omen which means comparatively
little to a man who is aware of
the thousand emotions that are responsible
for the blush of woman. I was again annoyed
by the discovery that my pulses
were not beating wildly, and that my heart
was not throbbing tumultuously, and when
I addressed a commonplace remark to her
I was thoroughly ashamed and humiliated.
It seemed like taking a mean advantage of
innocence and inexperience.</p>

<p>We sat together on the little bench,
and for the first time in our acquaintance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72" href="#Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
she appeared embarrassed, as if she knew
what was passing in my mind. I have
always believed that women, in addition
to their acknowledged intuition, have a
special sense that enables them to anticipate
a declaration of passion, and I had
no doubt that Phyllis was fully prepared
for my confession in spite of her embarrassment.
This induced me to proceed to the
point without unnecessary preliminaries.</p>

<p>"Phyllis," I said, not without a certain
agreeable ardor, "I have been talking with
Aunt Mary."</p>

<p>"Indeed?"</p>

<p>"And about you."</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"When I say that I have been talking
with Aunt Mary, and about you," I continued
in a grieved tone, for I do not
like jerky responses, "I wish you to
understand that it was in connection with
no ordinary topic. Phyllis,"&mdash;I spoke
with the utmost tenderness&mdash;"can you
not guess the nature of our discussion?"</p>

<p>Phyllis was equal to the emergency;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73" href="#Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
her embarrassment had disappeared. "I
am glad," she said, "that your conversation
so far as it related to me was out of the
ordinary. I suppose I may ask what the
topic was&mdash;that is, if you don't mind
telling."</p>

<p>This was approaching the serious.
"Phyllis, I was telling Aunt Mary that
I loved you and wished to make you my
wife."</p>

<p>A flash, half merry, half angry, came to
her eye. "That was thoughtful of you.
Is it customary for gentlemen in the city,
when they think they love a girl, to honor
all her relations with their confidence before
they speak to the girl herself?"</p>

<p>I took her hand. She made the slightest
motion to withdraw it, and permitted
it to remain in my grasp. "Phyllis," I
said with all earnestness, "do not misunderstand
me. I sought you at the
house. You were absent. Your Aunt
Mary and I have been friends from childhood,
and it was only natural that out of
my heart I spoke the words that were in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74" href="#Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
my mind. I told her that I loved you,
just as at that moment I might have
shouted it from the housetop. My heart
was full of you and I had to speak.
Can't you understand?"</p>

<p>The girl was still obdurate, and she
spoke with some petulance. "If that is
the case, perhaps it is just as well that it
was Aunt Mary and not one of the neighbors."</p>

<p>"Dear little Phyllis, you are not angry
with me because I love you? You cannot
remain angry with me because I confessed
my love before I met you to-day? If you
had only seen with what applications of
cold water your aunt rewarded my confidence,
you would pity and not reproach
me."</p>

<p>For a minute the girl was silent. Then
she asked softly: "How long have you
known that you loved me?"</p>

<p>"Must I answer that question candidly
and unreservedly?"</p>

<p>"Unreservedly and candidly."</p>

<p>I seized her other hand and held her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75" href="#Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
firmly. "About fifty minutes."</p>

<p>She laughed, rather joyously I thought.
"And having loved me for fully fifty minutes,
you wish to make me your wife?
Confiding man!"</p>

<p>"Little girl," I said tenderly, "let us
be serious. If my dull consciousness did
not awaken till an hour ago, my heart tells
me that I have loved you ever since I first
saw you standing near this spot. I am
not going to ask you now whether you
love me, or ever can learn to love me. It
is happiness enough for me to-day to know
how much I love you, and to know that I
have told you of that love. I do not care
to have my dream too rudely and too suddenly
dispelled. Very probably you do
not care for me as I should like to have
you care for me, but do not make a jest of
my affection. I am wholly aware of the
preposterousness of my demands in many
respects"&mdash;this sounded very conventional
and commonplace, but every lover
must say it&mdash;"and, believe me, I shudder
when I think of what I have dared confess."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76" href="#Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>Then she said with the most delightful
demureness: "Mr. Stanhope, is it likely
that a girl would sit in a burying-ground
on a bench with a gentleman, allowing him
to hold both her hands, unless she cared
for him a little&mdash;just a little?"</p>

<p>Up to this moment I had fairly forgotten
that I was depriving her of all power
of resistance, but with such encouragement
I took an even more sympathetic grasp
and sat a trifle closer, while the minutes
ticked away. A robin flew down from the
tree near by and saucily hopped toward
us, until at a rebuking call from his mate
he flew away, and I fancied that I could
hear them talking over the situation, and
drawing conclusions from their own happiness.
Phyllis was the first to break the
charming spell.</p>

<p>"Mr. Stanhope," she asked, hardly
above a whisper, "what did Aunt Mary
say when you told her that you wished to
make me your wife?"</p>

<p>"She said, Phyllis, that Providence may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77" href="#Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
have decreed that I am the man to bring
you happiness."</p>

<p>And still in that same enchanting whisper,
with her face a little rosier, as she half
hid it below my shoulder: "Mr. Stanhope,
do you think that a girl with my
Christian training could fly in the face of
Providence?"</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span style="margin-left: -.7em;"><b>HE</b></span> philosopher was in love. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79" href="#Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
comes, I have no doubt, to every
well-ordered man to be in love
once. Some there are who maintain, with
plausibility, that the passion we call love
may be of frequent recurrence, and they
point to the passing fancies of boys and
girls, the romances of moonlight, the repeated
sighings of the fickle Corydon,
and the matrimonial entanglements of the
aging Lydia, as evidence for their argument.
That there are varying degrees of
the ecstatic emotion cannot be truthfully
denied. Heaven has wisely decreed that
the heart, once filled with its ideal, may be
compensated for the bitter hour of sorrow
by the soothing balm of a new affection,
and it is even possible that the second love
may be more satisfying than the first, the
third or fourth more typical of exaltation
than its predecessors. But love, whether
early or late, in the perfect absorption of
the faculties comes only once; as compared
with this remarkable mental state all other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80" href="#Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
conditions are unemotional, unfilling.</p>

<p>The true lover rises early, before the
world is astir. If it is summer and in
the country, his thoughts lead him to the
cool groves, the shady banks of the river,
the retired spots where he may uninterruptedly
commune with his happiness or
his misery, and reflect on the blessings
that are to be, or should be, his. Was it
not then as a true lover that in the early
morning I walked into the country, and
down the banks of the stream where Sylvia
and I had strayed and talked in the
sunny days of youth? And nature seemed
a part of the wedding procession, and the
squirrels on the fence rails, and the robins,
wrens, and wood-thrushes in the trees
chirped and twittered: "John Stanhope is
in love! John Stanhope is in love!" And
the mocking crow, lazily flapping his
wings at a safe distance, croaked enviously:
"Ha, ha! old Stanhope is in love. Ha,
ha!" Yet the whole conspiracy of animated
nature could not make old Stanhope
in his present exaltation regretful of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81" href="#Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
his age or ashamed of his passion.</p>

<p>Mary Eastmann had accepted the situation
without comment. She neither congratulated
nor demurred, but went on
with her household duties with the same
method and precision as before. Men
may come and go, hearts may be won and
lost, republics may totter and empires may
fall, but the grand scheme of sweeping,
dusting, bed-making, and cooking knows
no interruption. If I did not understand
I at least commended this housewifely
prudence, and often when the domestic
battle was at its height I would spirit
away my little charmer for the discussion
of topics within my comprehension. At
the outset I had declared that while it had
pleased Providence to begin our romance
in a burying-ground, I did not propose
to sacrifice all tender sentiment to meditations
among the tombs, and I bore her
away to the old tree down by the river,
where we sat for hours together as I unfolded
my plans for our future life.</p>

<p>A man who has sat at the feet of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82" href="#Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
philosophers from Ovid to Schopenhauer,
and has gorged his intellect with the
abstract principles of love, naturally
adapts himself to the professorial capacity,
and I soon saw that Phyllis,
while one of the most lovable, one
of the sweetest of girls, was almost
wholly ignorant of the psychology of passion.
I could not expect that a young
girl of twenty-two would discourse glibly
of the emotion in its intellectual phase, but
I could not bear the thought that she
should enter lightly into so serious a compact,
and without gaining a reasonable
comprehension of its mental analysis.
Hence, as opportunity presented, I enriched
her mind with the beauties of love
from the standpoint of philosophers and
thinkers, and showed her the priceless
blessings that must result from a union
dictated by careful provision of reasoning.
To these addresses she listened with sweet
patience, and if she did not always grasp
their meaning, she showed much admiration
for my erudition and frequently remarked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83" href="#Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
that she had no idea that love was
so abstruse a science. It seemed to me,
in the serenity of my years and the calm
assurance of my love, that I was a most
persistent wooer, and I was greatly grieved
when she broke out rather petulantly one
afternoon:</p>

<p>"I don't believe you really love me."</p>

<p>"You don't believe I love you? And
why?"</p>

<p>She hesitated, half abashed by her own
outburst, then added a little defiantly:
"Well, in the first place, you never
quarrel with me."</p>

<p>"And why should I quarrel with you?
Aren't you the most amiable, the most
perfect little woman in the world?"</p>

<p>"Oh, of course; I know all that. But
I have always read, and always believed,
that when two persons are truly, deeply
in love, they have most exciting quarrels.
Is it not true that in all romances the
man is eternally quarrelling with the girl
and bidding her farewell forever?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and coming back in ten minutes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84" href="#Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
to weep and grovel at her feet and beg
her to forgive him. My dear little
Phyllis, why should I bid you farewell
forever, when I am morally certain that
in half that time I should be cringing
in the turf, weeping and begging you to
say that all is forgiven and forgotten?"</p>

<p>"That would be lovely," she said
pensively.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, but it would be very undignified
and unnecessary. And I am not
at all sure that you would admire me
in that attitude even if I did imitate the
heroes of romance. A weeping lover is
much more agreeable in a novel than
in actual life. However if you insist that
we must quarrel, in order to demonstrate
the sincerity of my affection, I shall suggest
that we have our spats when we
part for the night, in order that no precious
waking hours may be lost."</p>

<p>"You are joking," she exclaimed with
a little pout.</p>

<p>"Not at all. Still," I added reflectively,
"even this plan has its disadvantages,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85" href="#Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
for if we quarrel when we part
at night, it will necessitate my return
to your window, which would not only
annoy your aunt but might scandalize
the neighbors. Furthermore it might
give me a shocking cold, unless you
immediately repented, for the nights are
very damp. No," I sighed with great
feeling, "all this seems impracticable.
You must give me a better reason for
my coldness."</p>

<p>Phyllis toyed with a clover blossom,
and made no answer. I went on:</p>

<p>"As a slight indication of my unlover-like
hauteur, let me confess that I am
going to bring you a marvellously glittering
bauble when I come back from the
city, something that will bewilder you
by day and dazzle you by night."</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders. "Of
course you are; you are always giving
me presents."</p>

<p>I laughed at this. "Well, suppose
I am; I have never heard that it is a sign
of waning affection to bestow gifts on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86" href="#Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
loved one."</p>

<p>"You refuse me nothing. I dare say
you would give me the Boston State
House if I wished it."</p>

<p>"No, you are wrong there," I replied
decisively. "If I bought the State
House I should be compelled to include
the emblematic codfish, and you know my
aversion to codfish."</p>

<p>She smiled at the thought, recalling
the Sunday breakfast, and then with a
roguish look and a half-embarrassed laugh
she said: "At all events you cannot
deny that you did not kiss me when you
left last night."</p>

<p>"Didn't I?" I asked in amazement,
and then, quite thrown off my guard, I
added thoughtlessly: "I had forgotten."</p>

<p>"That," she replied quietly, "was
because you were so taken up with the
philosophy of love, and the mental attitude,
that you overlooked the physical
demonstration. Do you remember the
conversation?"</p>

<p>Unfortunately I did. I recalled that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87" href="#Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
I had spent an hour or more defining
the moral status of love and proving the
sufficing reason. It was not a pleasant
reflection that so agreeable and instructive
a conversation was not thoroughly
appreciated.</p>

<p>"We spoke at length on love," I ventured
feebly.</p>

<p>"That is, you did," she replied. "I'll
admit that it was better than an ordinary
sermon, because the subject was more
personal. But don't you think we
admitted the sufficing reason at the start,
and isn't it natural that a girl who has
been conventionally brought up is pretty
well satisfied in her own mind of the
moral status? Of course," she added,
with a toss of her pretty head, "I am
not asking you or anybody else to kiss
me. I am merely curious to know if
this plays any part in the philosophy
of love as understood by the greatest
thinkers."</p>

<p>Her speech had given me time to pull
myself together. "No," I said with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88" href="#Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
marked emphasis, "I did not kiss you,
because I had noted the unworthy suspicions
you have expressed to-day, and I
was hurt and grieved. It was hard for
me to exhibit my displeasure in this way,
and I am regretful now that I have learned
that it was simply playfulness on your
part. Don't interrupt. I am satisfied
that the pure merriment of your nature
is responsible for this assault, and I shall
take great pleasure in making up this
evening for the deficiencies of last night."</p>

<p>She laughed and we were friends again.
And with such jocular asperities the days
passed quickly and agreeably until my
nephew arrived with the plans and specifications.
Frederick Grinnell was not only
my nephew, but an architect of reputation
and promise, considering his years and experience.
Like Phyllis he had been left
an orphan early in life, and it had been my
pleasure and privilege to give him an education
and see that he was fairly started
in life. While I think I may say that
Frederick was not quite so attractive as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89" href="#Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
was I at his age, he was nevertheless a fine,
manly young fellow, tall, well put together,
of good habits, industrious and
devoted to his profession. It pleased me
to see that he admired Phyllis's pretty
face and bright, animated manner; but
one evening, when I fancied that he was
too deeply stirred by her really beautiful
voice, I took the opportunity to converse
with him confidentially as we walked
back to the tavern.</p>

<p>"I have been intending to tell you,
Frederick," I began a little airily, "of the
relations existing between Miss Kinglake
and myself. So far it has been a profound
secret"&mdash;I did not then know
that the entire village was gossiping about
it&mdash;"but I feel that I owe it to you, as
my nearest relative, to admit that Miss
Kinglake and I are engaged."</p>

<p>I paused, and noting that he did not
wince or appear in the least degree discomposed,
continued:</p>

<p>"Of course you will respect my confi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90" href="#Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>dence
in this matter. Of course," I added
magnanimously, "it will be perfectly
proper for you to signify to Miss Kinglake
that you are aware of our little secret
as that will put us all on a better
basis and lead to no misunderstandings.
It would be awkward to play at cross purposes,
and I should be extremely sorry,
my dear boy, to think that I had withheld
anything from you, for you have
always enjoyed my fullest trust."</p>

<p>Whatever he may have thought, his
manner betrayed no unusual interest.
"I congratulate you," he replied very
calmly.</p>

<p>Now that so perfect an understanding
existed in the immediate family circle, I
gave myself no further uneasiness. I
was truly rejoiced to notice that Frederick
was deferentially polite to Phyllis, and I
encouraged him to show her those polite
attentions which my betrothed would
reasonably expect from my nephew.
And at times I even insisted that he should
represent me at certain gatherings of
Phyllis's friends, who were too young and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91" href="#Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
frivolous to claim my serious attention.
When he protested, and pleaded headache,
business, or other sign of disinclination, I
rallied him good-humoredly on his lack
of gallantry.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, my boy," I argued; "a
young fellow of your spirit should be
only too glad to go out with a pretty girl
and enjoy himself. You certainly would
not deprive Phyllis of an evening's pleasure
because your uncle has a stiff knee
which interferes with his dancing, and&mdash;confound
it, you know they never let me
smoke at these frolics. Come now, be a
good fellow and show the proper family
impulse."</p>

<p>As they went off together I looked at
them admiringly and rather fancied that I
saw in them a suggestion of what Sylvia
and I had been when we made the rounds
of the birthday parties. For it is fair to
confess that the image of Sylvia did not infrequently
rise before me, and I constantly
saw in Phyllis the replica of her adorable
mother. In my happiest moments I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92" href="#Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
spoke of this suggestion to Phyllis, and
continued to regale her with fragments of
my early life associated with her family.
At first I thought that the girl was somewhat
piqued, fearing that Frederick was
thrust upon her, although she admitted
that he was good-looking, polite, and
danced extremely well, but I succeeded in
convincing her that true love should not
be gauged by the low standards of hot-night
dancing, and that all philosophers
agree that the purest affection springs from
quiet contemplation, such as I should enjoy
while she was making merry with her
friends. To this she once ventured to
remark that in that case perhaps my affection
would thrive to greater advantage if
I contented myself with thinking about
her and not seeing her at all, a suggestion
which wounded me in my tenderest sensibilities,
for I was very much in love. I
was also not a little disturbed when, supplemental
to my reminiscences, Mary
went back to the past and humorously
drew pictures of me as her own early<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93" href="#Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
lover. There is considerable difference
between the impalpable, airy spirit of the
fancy and a wrinkled and austere feminine
actuality of fifty.</p>

<p>In the midst of these innocent and improving
pleasures a small cloud appeared
in the summer sky. I received a letter
addressed in a peculiar but not ornate
hand, and I opened it with misgivings
and read it with consternation.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Mr. Stanhope sir</span>: Prudence and I thinks
youd better come home. The plummer was
hear twice yisterday and the cutworms is awfle.

<p class="cite">

<span class="smcap">Malachy</span>.<br />
</p></div>

<p>Duty is one of the exactions of life
which I have never shirked when there
seemed no possible way of evading it,
but in this instance the call of duty was
compromised by matters of equal urgency,
for nothing can be more important than
the successful administration of the affairs
of love. It was a happy thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94" href="#Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
that suggested to me a way out of the
difficulty, which was neither more nor less
than that we should all go to the city
together. I sprang the proposition at a
family conference. Phyllis was delighted.
"There is always so much to be seen in
the city," she cried, "and I shall meet
Mr. Bunsey. It has been one of the
dreams of my life to know a real literary
man."</p>

<p>This appeared to call for an explanation.
Heaven knows I am not jealous
of Bunsey, and would not deprive him of
a single distinction that is honestly his.
But a regard for the truth, coupled with
much doubt as to Bunsey's ability to live
up to such lively expectations, compelled
me to resort to a little gentle correction.</p>

<p>"My dear Phyllis," I said, "you must
disabuse your mind of that fallacy. Bunsey
is a popular novelist, not a literary
man."</p>

<p>"But isn't a novelist a literary man?"
she asked in amazement.</p>

<p>"Not necessarily," I replied pityingly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95" href="#Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
"In fact I may say not usually. Of course
we are speaking of popular novelists.
The popularity of the novelist is in proportion
to his lack of literary style. The
distinctive popular charm of Bunsey is
that he is not literary&mdash;at least, if he is,
his critics have not succeeded in discovering
it; he successfully conceals his crime.
If he is popular, it is because he is not
literary; if he were literary he could not
be popular."</p>

<p>"That does not seem right," said my
little Puritan.</p>

<p>"It is not a question of ethics at all,
but a matter of taste. However, don't be
prejudiced against Bunsey because he is
a product of the time and fairly representative
of the civilization. You shall meet
him and shall learn from him how a man
may succeed in so-called literature without
any hampering literary qualifications."</p>

<p>Mary did not receive my proposition
in a thankful and conciliatory spirit. She
shook her head doubtfully, and when we
were alone together, she gave voice to her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96" href="#Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
fears.</p>

<p>"Phyllis is country-bred," she said,
"and knows nothing of the toils and
snares that beset young girls in the
city."</p>

<p>"Toils and snares," I echoed. "One
might gather from your objections that we
contemplate taking Phyllis to the city
merely to expose her to temptation and
corrupt the serenity of her mind. You
seem to forget the elevating influences of
my modest home."</p>

<p>"No, John; I dare say that your home
is not objectionable, taken by itself. But
I am not blind to the seductions of the
great city. You too forget," she added,
with a touch of complacency, "that I am
not inexperienced or without knowledge
of the profligacy of the town."</p>

<p>"Granting all this," I said, highly diverted
by her earnestness, "and what are
some of these seductions you have in
mind?"</p>

<p>"Theatres," she replied promptly,
"theatres and late hours, midnight suppers&mdash;and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97" href="#Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
cocktails."</p>

<p>I laughed uproariously. "My dear
Mary, if these deadly sins and perils
alarm you, we'll cut them out. I care
little for theatres, and less for midnight
suppers. And as for cocktails, I shall
make it my peculiar charge to see that
Phyllis never hears the abominable word.
Allowing for the removal of these temptations,
I still think that a trip to the city
would do our country flower a world of
good, though I have nothing but praise
for the manner in which you have brought
her up."</p>

<p>"John," she answered very gravely,
"I have endeavored to do my duty as I
saw it. I have tried to bring Phyllis up
in the nurture and admonition of the
Lord."</p>

<p>The expression carried me back to my
childhood, and I bit my lips. "Of
course you have," I said. "Wasn't I
brought up in this same village, in the
same way? Did not my good mother
and my blessed, grandmother inflict nurture<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98" href="#Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
and admonition upon me, that I
might grow up as you see me, a true child
of the pilgrim fathers? The nurture, I
remember, was a particularly hard seat in
our particularly gloomy old meetinghouse,
and the admonition took up the
greater part of the Sabbath day, with a
disenchanting prospect of further admonition
at home if I failed to keep awake.
I do not mean to say that I am not
thankful for the experience. In truth I
am doubly thankful&mdash;thankful that I had
it, and thankful that it is over."</p>

<p>To this Mary vouchsafed no further
remonstrance than a distrustful shake of
the head. Excellent woman! Is it not
to such as you, earnest, faithful, self-sacrificing,
God-fearing, that the best in
young manhood, the purest in young
womanhood, owe the strength of the
qualities that are the vital force of the
nation?</p>

<hr />
<p>&nbsp;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99" href="#Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="dropcapn">I</span><span style="margin-left: -.7em;"><b>N</b></span> the end the united opposition was
too much for Mary's arguments, and
to town we went. The pleasure of
the journey, on my part, was somewhat
clouded as to the welcome we should receive
from Prudence, and truly it acquired
my greatest powers of dissimulation to
feign an easy indifference and air of
authority before that worthy creature, as
with the most studied politeness and
formal hospitality she received us at the
gate. Prudence and I had sparred so
many years that we were like two expert
athletes, and while neither apparently
noticed the other, each was perfectly
conscious of the adversary's slightest
movement. Hence I detected at once
her strong aversion to Mary, whom she
immediately selected as a probable mistress,
and I saw her several times vainly
try to repress a grimace of disdain and
wrath. It was my first impulse to follow
Prudence into the kitchen, after the ladies
had gone to their rooms, and make a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100" href="#Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
clean breast of the untoward tidings, but
I lacked the moral courage and contented
myself with an inward show of strength.
Why should I pander to this woman's
caprices? Was I not master in my own
house? Should I not do as I pleased?
I would punish her with the severity of
my silence, and perhaps in a week or two,
when she was more tractable, I would
condescend to tell her exactly how matters
stood. In this I would be firm.</p>

<p>But the next morning, before my guests
were out of bed, I decided that I was not
acting wisely. Was not Prudence an
old, faithful, and trustworthy servant?
Had she not been loyal to my interests,
and was not her whole life wrapped up
in my comfort? Surely I wronged her
to withhold from her the confidence she
had so fairly earned, and the flush of
shame came to my face as I reflected that
I was indulging my first deceit. I took
a turn in the garden, in the heavenly cool
of the early morning, to compose my
nerves for a very probable ordeal, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101" href="#Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
then I walked boldly into the kitchen
where Prudence sat, with a wooden bowl
in her lap, paring apples.</p>

<p>It was one of the unwritten laws of the
cuisine that Prudence was never to be disturbed
when engaged in this delicate
operation. She maintained that it destroyed
the symmetry of the peel, and
I dare say she was right. Consequently
she looked at me reproachfully as I
entered, and bent again more assiduously
to her work. I was much flustered by
the ill omen, but I knew that if I hesitated
I was lost; so I advanced valorously,
though with accelerated pulse, and
said with all the calmness I could
command:</p>

<p>"Prudence, I think it only right to tell
you that I am going to be married."</p>

<p>One apple rolled from the bowl down
along the floor and under the kitchen
stove. I cannot conceive of any shock,
however great, that would cause Prudence
to lose more than one apple. Partly to
conciliate, and partly to conceal my own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102" href="#Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
trepidation, I made a gallant effort to
rescue the wanderer, and as I poked the
hiding-place with my stick, I heard her
say: "Lord, I know'd it'd come!"</p>

<p>"The fact that it has come, Prudence,"
I answered with a sickly attempt at
gayety, "does not seem to be a reason
why you should call with such vehemence
on your Maker. There does not
appear to be any need of Providential
interposition. Things are not so bad
as all that."</p>

<p>I always used my most elegant English
when conversing with Prudence. If she
did not understand it, it flattered her to
think that I paid this tribute to her
intelligence.</p>

<p>"Mr. John," she said, and there was
a suspicious break in her voice, "for
twenty years I have tried to do my duty
by you, and now that I must go&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go?" I interrupted; "who said
you must go? Who spoke about anybody's
going? You certainly do not
expect to turn that bowl of apples over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103" href="#Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
to me and leave me to get breakfast?"</p>

<p>"No, Mr. John, I shall go on and do
my duty, as I see it, until you have made
all your plans and are comfortable."</p>

<p>"Now, look here, Prudence, I am very
comfortable as things are, thank you.
And you will pardon me if I say I cannot
understand why you should go at all. I
shall continue to eat, I hope, after I am
married, and I think it altogether probable
that I shall require a house-keeper and
a cook. I believe they do have such
things in well-regulated families."</p>

<p>"At my age, and with my experience,
and considerin' how we have lived, Mr.
John, I couldn't get along with a mistress,
'specially," she added with a touch
of malice, "with a woman considerable
older than me."</p>

<p>"Older than you? What are you
talking about? Miss Kinglake is young
enough to be your daughter."</p>

<p>Another apple rolled on the floor.
"Miss Kinglake!" she exclaimed in
astonishment, "that lamb? Good Lord,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104" href="#Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
I thought you were goin' to marry the
other one!"</p>

<p>"Prudence," I said rather hotly, for I
did not relish her amazement, "you will
oblige me by not speaking of these ladies
as the 'lamb' and 'the other one.' I might
gather from your remarks that I am a sort
of ravening wolf, instead of a well-meaning
gentleman who is merely exercising
the privilege of selecting a wife. But,"
I said, checking myself, for I was ashamed
of my explosion, "I shall be magnanimous
enough to believe that you are delighted
with my choice, and that I have your
congratulations. You will be glad to
know that Miss Kinglake and I are
perfectly satisfied with each other, and
that we are both entirely satisfied with
you. And now that we understand the
situation, I think I may presume that
we shall have breakfast at the usual hour
this morning, and to-morrow morning,
and for many mornings to come. And,
by the way, Prudence, while I have
honored you with my confidence, permit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105" href="#Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
me to impress it upon you that this
revelation is not village gossip as yet,
and you will put me under further obligations
by not mentioning the circumstance.
Good-morning, Prudence. Kindly call
the ladies at eight o'clock."</p>

<p>And thereupon I hastily departed,
leaving the good woman in a state of
stupefaction, since, for the first and only
time in our long and controversial association,
had I retired with the last word.
Taking a second turn in the garden
I encountered Malachy, and my conscience
reproached me. "Am I doing
right," I asked myself, "in withholding
the glad news from this faithful servant
who has shown himself so worthy of my
confidence? Is it not my duty to tell
him&mdash;not so much to interest him in
his future mistress as to demonstrate the
trust I repose in him?"</p>

<p>Malachy received my confidence with
less excitement than I had expected. In
fact I was slightly humiliated by his seeming
lack of gratitude. He touched his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106" href="#Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
hat very respectfully, and observed irrelevantly
that the roses below the arbor
were looking uncommonly well. This
was a poor reward for my attempt at
consideration, and further convinced me
of the uselessness of establishing anything
like intimate relations with the
proletariat.</p>

<p>"By the way, Malachy," I said in
parting, "you will keep this matter a
profound secret. Miss Kinglake and I
are desirous that we shall not be annoyed
by village chatter and premature
congratulations."</p>

<p>Having discharged my duty to my
good servants, I felt that my obligations,
so far as the relation with Phyllis was
concerned, were at an end, and the morning
wore away without further misgivings
of disloyalty. In the afternoon Bunsey
came over for his daily smoke, and as we
sat together in the library, and I noticed
the entire absence of suspicion in his
manner, my heart smote me. "Truly,"
I reasoned silently, "I am behaving ill to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107" href="#Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
an old friend who has never withheld
from me the very secrets of his soul.
Should I not be as generous, as outspoken,
with him as he has always proved
to me? Should I not confide to him this
one precious secret, at the same time
swearing him to preserve it as he would
his life?"</p>

<p>I blew out a ring of smoke, and then
I began with the utmost seriousness:
"Bunsey, how do you like the ladies?"</p>

<p>He shifted his position, tipped the
ashes from his cigar, and replied tranquilly:
"Oh, I dare say I shall in
time."</p>

<p>The answer vexed me. Bunsey was a
bachelor, and should have been therefore
the more impressionable. I forgot for the
moment, in my annoyance, that he was
a novelist, and had been so diligently
creating lovely and impossible women to
order that he was not easily moved by
the realities of humanity.</p>

<p>"At all events," I replied with delicate
irony, "I am glad that the future is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108" href="#Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
hopeful for the ladies. My reason for
asking the question was simply to lead
the way to a confidence I intend to repose
in you. To proceed expeditiously
to the end of a long story, I intend to
marry one of them."</p>

<p>Bunsey's tranquillity was unshaken.
"Which one?"</p>

<p>"Which one?" I echoed with heat,
"why, Miss Kinglake, of course."</p>

<p>"Does she intend to marry you?"</p>

<p>"Naturally."</p>

<p>"Or unnaturally?"</p>

<p>"Confound your impertinence!" I
roared, "what do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>"No impertinence, at all, my dear
fellow. In fact it is most pertinent.
Miss Kinglake is a girl, and you&mdash;well,
you voted for Grant."</p>

<p>"Which is your gentle way of saying
that I am too old."</p>

<p>"No, not too old; just old enough&mdash;to
know better."</p>

<p>"We are never too old to love," I
said, conscious that I was uttering a melancholy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109" href="#Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
platitude.</p>

<p>"Too old to love? Heaven forbid!
But we may be too old to marry&mdash;at
least to marry anybody worth while.
Come, Stanhope, tell me: do you really
love this young woman?"</p>

<p>"Love her? Here I have been telling
you that I intend to marry a charming
girl, and you turn about and ask me if I
love her. Of course I love her. I have
been loving her in one way and another
for years."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that? I thought
you only met her a few weeks ago."</p>

<p>I smiled pityingly. "So I did, but
for years she has been my affinity. Incidentally
I don't mind saying I began by
loving her mother."</p>

<p>Bunsey sat up straight. "Oh, you
loved her mother. Was her mother
pretty?"</p>

<p>"She was as you see Phyllis. In fact
I think she was, if anything, a trifle prettier.
We were playmates and schoolmates,
and in the nature of things, if I had not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110" href="#Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
wandered off to the city, I presume we
should have married. Dear little Sylvia,"
I went on musingly, "I can see her at
this moment, looking down from heaven
and smiling on my union with her daughter.
For if ever a match was made in heaven
this was. Confound it! what are you
doing now?"</p>

<p>While I was talking Bunsey had reached
over, taken a sheet of paper and was busily
writing. He looked up carelessly.</p>

<p>"Your story interests me, and is such
good material that I thought I would make
a few notes. Young boy loves young
girl&mdash;goes to city&mdash;forgets her&mdash;young
girl marries&mdash;has charming daughter&mdash;dies&mdash;years
pass&mdash;venerable gentleman
returns&mdash;sees daughter&mdash;great emotion
on part of v. g.&mdash;thinks he loves her&mdash;proposes&mdash;accepted&mdash;mar&mdash;no,
there I
think I must stop for the present."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't stop there, I beg," I said
sarcastically; "if you are thinking of using
these materials for one of your popular
novels, be sure to throw in a few duels,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111" href="#Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
several heartrending catastrophes, and
other incidents of what you call 'action,'
appropriately expressed in bad English."</p>

<p>Bunsey was imperturbable. "Thank
you for your appreciative estimate of my
literary style," he replied coolly; "but
really, my consideration for my old friend
deprives me of the pleasure of robbing his
diary."</p>

<p>I was still out of temper. "Bunsey,
I don't mind favoring you with a further
confidence. You're an ass!"</p>

<p>With this parting shot I strode out of
the library, when, remembering the sacredness
of my revelation, I turned back.</p>

<p>"Of course you will understand, Bunsey,
that however flippantly you may
choose to regard what I have said to you,
you will have the decency to keep the
subject-matter to yourself. I do not ask
your congratulations or your approval, but
I demand your secrecy."</p>

<p>"The ass brays acknowledgments,"
answered Bunsey meekly, helping himself
to another cigar. "You may rely on my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112" href="#Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
loyal and devoted interest. The fact that
I have heard your secret twice before to-day
shall not open my lips or cause me to
violate your trust."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding my attitude of indifference
I was greatly troubled by Bunsey's
unfeeling suggestion. Could it be possible
that I had mistaken my own heart?
Was I, yielding, as I had believed, to the
first strong passion of my life, only deluding
myself with a remembrance of my
vanished youth? I dismissed the thought
impatiently. For, after all, was not Bunsey
a hopeless cynic, a fellow without a single
emotion of the ennobling sentiment of
man toward woman, a sordid story-teller,
who created characters for money, wrecked
homes, committed literary murders, played
unfeelingly on the tenderest sensibilities,
and boasted openly that the only
angels were those made by a stroke of the
pen and retailed at department store book-counters?
And while thus reasoning
Phyllis came to me, so winsome in her
girlish beauty, so radiant in the happiness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113" href="#Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
I had infused into her life, so joyous
in the pleasures of the present, that I
laughed at my own doubts, reproached
myself for my own unworthy suspicions,
and straightway forgot both Bunsey and
his evil promptings.</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114" href="#Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">L</span><span style="margin-left: -.7em;"><b>OVE</b></span> at eight and forty is a very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115" href="#Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
pleasant and indolent emotion,
marking the most delightful stage
in the progress of the great human
passion. At twenty-five we talk it; at
thirty-five we act it; at forty-five it is
pleasant to sit down and think about
it. The very young man loves without
really analyzing. Ten years later he
analyzes without really loving. In another
decade he has compounded the proportions
of love and analysis, and becomes,
under favoring conditions, the most
dangerous and hence the most acceptable
of suitors. The man in middle life takes
his adored one tolerantly, and keeps his
reservations to himself. In the ordinary
course of events he has acquired a certain
knowledge of feminine character, he
knows the rocks and the shoals of love,
and, skillful pilot that he is, he avoids
them. He is sure of his course, master
of his equipment. If he errs at all&mdash;but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116" href="#Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
I anticipate.</p>

<p>Those were very joyous days, notwithstanding
the applications of cold water
so liberally bestowed by my confidential
advisers. And eagerly and successfully
I exerted myself to convince the doubting
ones in general, and Bunsey in particular,
how absurd were their suspicions,
and how apparent it was that Phyllis and
I had been purposely created for each
other. Mary threw herself into our
pleasures as heartily and joyously as
her New England nature would permit,
which was never a very riotous demonstration,
and Phyllis, with the effervescence
and enthusiasm of girlhood, eagerly
assented to every proposition that had
its pleasure-seeking side; while I, as a
thoughtful lover should, busied myself
in schemes for summer dissipation, thankful
that it was in my power to prove
so devoted a knight, and inwardly rejoicing
at my triumph over those who had
taxed me with such unworthy thoughts.
Even Frederick&mdash;good fellow that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117" href="#Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
was&mdash;allowed himself unusual days of
vacation to partake of our merriment,
and it pleased me greatly to see that when
business cares or physical disinclination
kept me off the programme, he no longer
allowed his indifference to interfere with
his duty as my nephew and personal
representative. Such, I take it, is the
obligation of all young men similarly
placed.</p>

<p>For, before many weeks had passed,
I discovered that it was not wise to allow
the fleeting dissipations of the moment,
however alluring, to monopolize time
which should be given to the serious
affairs of life. I found that a cramped
position in a boat in the hot sun brought
on nervous headaches, and that too much
time in the garden when the dew
was falling was conducive to lumbago.
Furthermore I had been invited by a
neighboring university to deliver my celebrated
lecture on the protagonism of
Plato, and several new and excellent
thoughts had come to me which required<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118" href="#Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
careful and elaborate development. I
explained these matters conscientiously
and fully to Phyllis, and while she offered
no unreasonable protest, her pretty face
clouded, and she did me the honor to
say that half the enjoyment was removed
by my absence. Once she even went
so far as to declare that Plato was a
"horrid man," and that she believed I
thought more of him than of her&mdash;a
most ridiculous conclusion but so essentially
feminine that I forgave her at once.
And, when she came to me, and put
her arms around my neck and urged me
to go with her to a tennis match&mdash;a
foolish game where grown-up people
knock little balls over a net with a battledore&mdash;I
pointed out to her that such
spectacles, while eminently proper for
young folk, argued a failing mind in those
of maturer years. With a charming pout
she said:</p>

<p>"Do you think you would have refused
to go if my mother had asked you?"</p>

<p>Now tennis is a sport that has come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119" href="#Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
up since Sylvia and I were children
together, but I recalled, with a guilty
blush, the time when she and I won the
village championship in doubles in an
all day siege of croquet, so what could
I say in my own defence? Therefore
I went with Phyllis to the tennis-court
and sat for two long and inexpressibly
dreary hours watching the senseless and
stupid proceedings. It was pleasant to
reflect that I was with Sylvia's daughter,
and I tried to imagine that the keen
interest of youth still remained, but I
was sadly out of place. I am satisfied
that this game of tennis has nothing of
the fascinating quality of croquet. On
our arrival home Phyllis kissed me, and
thanked me for what she called my
"self-denial," but after that one experience
Frederick represented me at the
tennis-court, as, indeed, the good-natured
boy consented to do at many similar
festivities.</p>

<p>And so the summer wore gradually
away, one day's enjoyment lazily following<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120" href="#Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
another's, with nothing to disturb the
serenity of my life, or to interfere with the
calm content into which I had settled.
Phyllis was everything that a moderate
and reasonable lover could wish&mdash;kind,
gentle, affectionate within the bounds of
maidenly discretion, attentive to my wishes,
and considerate of my caprices. The more
I saw of her the more I was persuaded
that I had chosen wisely and well. One
afternoon&mdash;Frederick, at my suggestion,
had gallantly given up his work in the
office and taken Phyllis down the river.
I sat with Bunsey in the library, and took
occasion to expound to him the philosophy
of perfect love.</p>

<p>"The trouble is," I said, "that people
rush blindly into matrimony. They think
they are in love, work themselves up to
the proper pitch of madness, propose and
marry while they are in delirium. Hence,
so much of the wretchedness and misery
that we see in the homes of our friends.
For my part I am committed to the doctrine
of affinities. It is true that I, like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121" href="#Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
many others, was guilty of the usual folly
in my youth, and perhaps that gave me
the wisdom to wait for my second venture
until precisely the fight party came along.
Matrimony, Bunsey, is an exact science.
If we regulate our passion, control all silly
emotion, study feminine nature as critically
and methodically as we investigate
a mathematical problem, and commit ourselves
only when the affinity presents herself,
we shall make no mistakes. For,
after all, what is an affinity? Nothing
more than a human being sent by Providence
as perfectly adapted to the wheels
and curves of your nature."</p>

<p>"A very pretty theory," retorted Bunsey,
grimly; "and, by the way, when do
you think of rushing into matrimony?"</p>

<p>"Really," I said, somewhat confused,
"to be entirely honest with you, I have
not settled on any particular day. You
see Phyllis should have her fling. She is
very young."</p>

<p>"True, but you are not."</p>

<p>As Bunsey said this he rose and tossed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122" href="#Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
his cigar out of the window. "Stanhope,"
he went on, "we are old friends, and I don't
wish to be continually seeming to interfere
with your business, but if I were a man with
fifty years leering hideously at me, and
engaged to a pretty girl of two and twenty,
I'd make quick work of it before Providence
came along with a younger affinity
in a Panama hat, neglig&eacute;e shirt, and duck
trousers."</p>

<p>I stared at him with a sort of helpless
amazement. "Exactly what do you
mean?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Well," he answered, shrugging his
shoulders, "at the risk of being kicked
out of the house, let me say that I think
such an affinity has already presented himself."</p>

<p>"Indeed, and who may that be?"</p>

<p>"Suppose we say Frederick."</p>

<p>"My nephew?"</p>

<p>"Exactly; your nephew. He is an uncommonly
good-looking fellow, and,
thanks to his uncle's childlike belief in
Providence and the doctrine of affinities,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123" href="#Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
he has most unusual opportunities to test
that doctrine for himself. I dare say that
he is making a formal study of the situation
at this very moment, and inviting
Providence to appear on the scene as his
sponsor."</p>

<p>What more was said at this interview, if,
indeed, it did not terminate with this brutal
statement, I cannot recall, for Bunsey,
usually so flippant and cynical, spoke with
an earnestness that stunned me. My
knowledge of the philosophy of love told
me that he was wrong; my observation of
the actualities of life made me fear that
he might be right. Theoretically, I could
not have been mistaken in my course;
practically, I began to see weak spots in the
chain of evidence. Swiftly, I ran over
the events of the spring and summer, and
as little spots no bigger than a man's hand
magnified themselves into black clouds,
Bunsey, sitting opposite, seemed to grow
larger and larger, and his smile more malicious
and demon-like. Possibly, had I
been a younger and more impetuous man,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124" href="#Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
I should have flown into a passion, taken
Bunsey at his word, and kicked him out
of the house; but the philosophy of the
thing engrossed me, filled me with half
fear, half curiosity, and engaged all my
mental faculties. Had I been mistaken?
Could I be deceived in the daughter of
Sylvia?</p>

<p>However strong my suspicions may
have been, they were not increased when,
with the evening, Phyllis and Frederick
came home from their excursion. Never
was Phyllis more unreserved, more cordial,
more joyous, more attentive to the little
wants, which I, in a mean and shameful
test, imposed on her. She could not be
acting a part, this New England girl, with
her alert conscience, her Puritan impulse
and training, her aversion to everything
that savored of deceit. And Frederick
was as much at his ease as if I knew
nothing, as if I had not heard of his duplicity,
as if the whole house and grounds
were not ringing with accusations of his
unworthiness. Such are the phenomena<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125" href="#Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
of the philosophy of middle life, I insisted
that he should remain for the
evening, and, after dinner, with that contrariness
accountable only in a true student
of psychology, I made a trifling
excuse and walked down to the square,
leaving them together.</p>

<p>The curfew was ringing as, returning,
I entered the lower gate at the end of the
garden, and passed slowly along by the
arbor. It may have been Providence, it
may have been chance, it certainly was
not philosophy that directed my steps
to the far side of the syringa hedge which
shut me off from the view of those who
might come down to the rustic seat at
the foot of the cherry tree. At least I
had no intention of playing the spy, and
when I heard Frederick's voice, and knew
instinctively that Phyllis was with him, I
quickened my pace that I might not be
a sharer of their secrets. But an irresistible
impulse made me pause when I
heard the foolish fellow say:</p>

<p>"After to-night I shall not come again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126" href="#Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
It is better for us to break now than to
wait until it is too late."</p>

<p>Her reply I could not hear. Presently
he said, and a little brokenly:</p>

<p>"I have fought it all out. It has been
hard, so hard, but I must meet it as it
comes."</p>

<p>Then I heard Phyllis's voice: "It is
for the best."</p>

<p>"I believe that you care for me. I
know how much I care for you, and how
much this effort is costing me. We were
too late. No other course in honor
presents itself. God knows how eagerly
and hopelessly I have sought a way out
of this tangle of duty."</p>

<p>Again I heard Phyllis's voice, sunk
almost to a whisper: "I have given my
word; it is for the best."</p>

<p>"The governor has been so good to
me," Frederick exclaimed resentfully,
"that I feel like a criminal even at this
moment when I am making for him the
sacrifice of a life. He has been my
father, my protector. What I am I owe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127" href="#Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
to him, and I must meet him like a grateful
and honest man. You would not
have it otherwise?"</p>

<p>And for the third time Phyllis answered:
"It is for the best."</p>

<p>Had I been of that remarkable stuff
of which your true hero is made, of which
Bunsey's heroes are made, and had I
come up to the very reasonable expectations
of the followers of literary romance,
I should have burst through the syringa
with passion in my face and rage in my
heart and precipitated a tragedy. Or, on
the other side, I should have taken those
ridiculous children by the hand, and ended
their suffering with my blessing then and
there. But as I am only of very common
clay, with little liking for heroics, I did
what any selfish and unappreciative man
would have done, and stole quietly away.
I even felt a sort of fierce joy in the
knowledge of the security of my position,
a mean exultation in the thought that
Phyllis was bound to me, and that those
from whom I might reasonably fear the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128" href="#Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
most, acknowledged the hopelessness of
their case. Most strangely there came to
me no resentment with the knowledge
that I had been supplanted by my nephew
in the affections of the girl; the fact that
she loved another surprised rather than
agitated me. My argument was upset,
my doctrine of affinities had been seriously
damaged in my individual case, and here
was I, who should have been yielding to
the pangs of disappointment, or raging
with wounded pride, reflecting with considerable
calmness on the reverses of a
philosopher.</p>

<p>I went into the library and lighted
a cigar. I threw myself into an easy-chair,
and as I looked up I saw a spider-web
in a corner of the ceiling. "I must
speak to Prudence about that in the
morning," I said to myself with annoyance.
Then for the first time it came
to me that I was out of temper, for I am
customarily tranquil and not easily upset.
My mind wandered rapidly from one
thing to another, and oddly enough I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129" href="#Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
caught myself humming a little tune
which had no sort of relevancy to the
events of the day. I tried to dismiss the
incident of the garden as the temporary
folly of a romantic girl, which would
wear itself out with a week's absence.
Why should it trouble me? Had I
been lacking in kindness or affection?
Should I be disturbed because a few
boat rides and the influence of moonlight
had wrought on a mere child? Was
I not secure in her promise, and had
I not heard her say she had given her
word? As for Frederick, was he not
my debtor? Had he not confessed it?
Then why give more thought to the
matter? It was awkward, but both were
young and both would outlive it. Sylvia
and I were young, and we outlived it.</p>

<p>But still kept ringing in my ears that despairing
half-whisper: "It is for the best."</p>

<p>Petulantly I threw away my cigar and
went up to my room. I walked over
to the dressing-case and turned up the
gas. The shadow displeased me and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130" href="#Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
I lighted the opposite jet. Then I stood
squarely before the mirror and looked
critically at the reflection.</p>

<p>Yes, John Stanhope, you are growing
old. That expanding forehead, with the
retreating hairs, tells the tale of time.
The gray upon your cheeks is whitening
and the razor must be used more vigilantly
to further deception. Those
creases in your face can no longer be
dismissed as character lines; the shagginess
of your eyebrows has the flying
years to account for it. Plainly, John,
you and humbug must part company.
You are not of this generation and it
is not for you.</p>

<p>I turned down the gas, threw open the
window and let the moonlight filter in
through the elms and over the tops of
the little pines. The soft beauty of the
night soothed me, and gradually and
very gently my irritation and annoyance
slipped away. Why should not a young
girl, radiant in youth and beauty, affect
a young man of her generation? What<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131" href="#Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
has an old fellow, with all his money and
worldly experience and burnt-out youth,
to give in exchange for that intoxication
which every girl may properly regard her
lawful gift? Undoubtedly I should make
a better husband, as husbands go, than
my romantic nephew, and any woman
of rare common sense would see the
advantages of my position, but why
burden a woman with that rare common
sense which robs her of the first and
sweetest of her dreams? No, John
Stanhope, go back to your pipe and your
books and your gardening, your life of
selfish, indolent do-nothing. Take life
as it comes most easily and naturally. By
sparing one heart you may save two.</p>

<p>And that nephew of mine&mdash;what a
fine, manly fellow he proved himself when
put to the test! The governor had
been good to him and he was going to
stand by the governor. How my heart
jumped, and what a warm little feeling
there was about the internal cockles as
I recalled his words. Bravely said, my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132" href="#Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
boy, and nobly done! I fear I should
not have been so generous at your age,
and with Sylvia&mdash;</p>

<p>And with Sylvia! How the past
crowded back at the thought of her!
Who are you, old dreamer, who neglected
the gift the good gods provided in the
heydey of your youth to return to chase
the phantom of the past? Behind that
little white cloud, sailing far into the
north, Sylvia may be peeping at you,
and smiling at the delusion of her ancient
wooer. Or why not think that she is
pleading with you&mdash;pleading for her
child and the lover, as she might have
pleaded for herself and somebody else,
had somebody else known his own heart
before it was too late?</p>

<p>I watched the white cloud as it passed
on and on, growing smaller and fainter
as it receded. I settled back still deeper
in my chair and sighed. And then&mdash;O
unworthy knight of love!&mdash;and then,
I fell asleep.</p>

<hr />
<p>&nbsp;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133" href="#Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="dropcapn">I</span><span style="margin-left: -.7em;"><b>N</b></span> the morning, before the family was
astir, I wrote a note, pleading a sudden
and imperative call to town, and
vanished for the day. I argued with myself
that such a step was a delicate consideration
for a young woman, who, having
listened to a confession of love a few
hours before, would be hardly at her ease
at a breakfast-table conversation. Incidentally
I was not altogether sure of
myself, although I was much refreshed
by an excellent night's sleep which comes
to every philosopher with courage and
strength to rise above the unpleasant
things of life. If Phyllis had yielded to
an emotion of grief, there was little trace
of it when we met at evening. I fancied
that she was somewhat paler, and her
manner at times seemed a little listless,
but otherwise there was no great departure
from her usual demeanor. As for myself
the long sunshine of a summer day
and the conviction that at last the opportunity
had come to me to play the r&ocirc;le<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134" href="#Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
of a minor hero gave me a peace that
amounted almost to buoyancy. No need
had I of the teachings of the musty old
philosophers reposing on my bookshelves.
John Stanhope had learned more of life
in a few short hours than all his tomes
could impart. His books had helped
him many times in diagnosing the cases
of his friends; when John fell ill they
mocked and deceived him.</p>

<p>Opportunely enough Phyllis followed
me into the library, and when at my request
she sat on a little stool at my feet,
and I held her hand and stroked her soft
light hair, a pang went through my heart,
for I felt that she might be near me for
the last time. The philosopher had yet
much to learn. For several minutes we
were both silent. Of the two I was
doubtless the more ill at ease, though I
concealed it bravely.</p>

<p>"Phyllis," I said at last, "did you ever
get over a childish fondness for fairy-stories?"</p>

<p>She smiled at this&mdash;was I wrong<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135" href="#Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
in fancying that her smile was that
of sadness?&mdash;and answered: "I hope
not."</p>

<p>"Because," I went on, bending over
and affectionately patting the hand I held,
"a little fairy-tale has been running
through my head all day, and I have decided
that you shall be the first to hear it
and pass on its merits. And because," I
added gayly, "if it has your approval I
may wish to publish it. Shall I begin?"</p>

<p>She nodded her head&mdash;I could swear
now to the weariness the poor child was
so staunchly fighting&mdash;and looked off
toward the sunset.</p>

<p>"Once upon a time&mdash;you see that I
am conventional&mdash;there lived a beautiful
young princess, on whom a wicked old
troll had cast an evil eye. Now this
wicked troll was not so hideous as the
trolls we see in our fairy-books&mdash;I must
say that&mdash;but he was so wicked that even
this deficiency could not excuse him. The
princess was as young and innocent&mdash;I
was going to say as simple&mdash;as she was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136" href="#Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
beautiful, and the wicked troll talked so
much of his experience in the world, and
boasted so hugely of his wealth and generosity
and other shining virtues, that the
imagination of the poor little princess was
quite fired, and she was flattered into
thinking that here was a treasure not to
be lightly put aside. And so, in a foolish
moment she consented to be his bride,
and he took her away to his castle&mdash;I
believe trolls do have castles&mdash;to make
ready for the marriage. While the preparations
were going on, and the wicked
old troll was laughing with glee to think
how he had deluded a princess, a handsome
young prince appeared on the scene,
and what so natural as that the princess
should immediately contrast him with the
troll. And it came about, also quite
naturally, that before the prince and the
princess knew that anything was happening,
they fell so violently in love with
each other that the birds, and the bees,
and the flowers in the garden, and the
squirrels in the trees sang and hummed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137" href="#Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
and gossiped and chattered about it."</p>

<p>Here I paused. Phyllis did not look
up, but I felt a shiver run through her
body as I stroked her hair and put my
arm around her shoulder to caress away
her fear.</p>

<p>"But it happened that although the
princess was so much in love that at times
she must have forgotten even the existence
of the old troll, she was still possessed of
that most inconvenient and annoying internal
arrangement which we call the New
England conscience, and one night, when
the prince had declared his love with more
ardor than usual, she remembered the
past, how she had promised to marry the
troll, and how she must keep her word,
as all good princesses do. And the prince,
who was a very upright young man, most
foolishly listened to her, and agreed to
give her up. Whereupon these poor
children, having resolved that it was for
the best&mdash;"</p>

<p>Phyllis looked up quickly. Her face
was white, and a look, half of fear, half of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138" href="#Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
reproach, came to her eyes. She sank
down and hid her face in her hands.
Both my arms were around her and I
even laughed.</p>

<p>"Dear little princess," I whispered, "don't
give way yet. The best is still to come. For
you must remember that this is a fairy-tale
and all fairy-tales have a good ending.
And, to make a long story short, this
wicked old troll was not a troll at all, but a
fairy-godmother, who had taken the form
for good purposes. I would have said
fairy-godfather, but I have never come
across a fairy-godfather in all my reading,
and I must be truthful. Well, the fairy-godmother
came along right in the nick of
time&mdash;and, of course, you know who
married and lived happily ever after?"</p>

<p>The convulsive movement of the poor
child's body told me she was weeping.
And I, being a philosopher, and more
or less hard-hearted, as all philosophers
are, let her weep on. Presently she said
in a voice hardly audible:</p>

<p>"I gave you my promise and I meant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139" href="#Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
to keep it. I am trying so hard to keep
it."</p>

<p>"Of course you are, little girl, but why
try? A bad promise is far better broken
than kept, and, come to think of it, I am
not at all sure that I am anxious to have
you keep it. How do you know that I
am not making a desperate effort to secure
my own release?"</p>

<p>She raised her head quite unexpectedly
and caught me with the tears in my eyes.
My eyes always were weak. "Why, you
are crying!" she said.</p>

<p>"Of course I'm crying. I always cry
when I am particularly well pleased. It
is a family peculiarity. You should see
me at the theatre. At a farce comedy I
am a depressing sight, and that is the
reason I always avoid the front seats."</p>

<p>Then realizing that I might be carrying
my gayety too far, I went on more soberly:</p>

<p>"Can't you see, Phyllis, that the old
fool's romance must come to an end?
Don't you understand that had I the
selfish wish to hold you to a thoughtless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140" href="#Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
promise, our adventure would terminate
only in misery to us both? Perhaps you
and I have been the last to see it, I, because
I was thinking too much of myself,
you, because you were carried away by an
exalted sense of duty. Thank heaven it
is clear to us both now. For it is clear,
isn't it, dear?"</p>

<p>The foolish girl did not reply, but she
kissed my hand, and it is astonishing how
that little act of affection touched and
strengthened me.</p>

<p>"So we are going to make a new start
and begin right. To-morrow I shall see
Frederick and make a proposition to
him, and if that rascal does not give up
his heroics and come down to his plain
duty as I see it&mdash;well, so much the
worse for him. No, don't raise objections"&mdash;she
had started to speak&mdash;"for
I am always quarrelsome when I cannot
have my own way. Go to your room
and think it over, and remember," I said
more gently, for that old tide of the past
was coming in, "that you are Sylvia's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141" href="#Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
daughter, and that Sylvia would have
trusted me and counselled you to obey
me in all things."</p>

<p>Slowly and with averted face Phyllis
rose and walked toward the door. I had
commanded her, and yet I felt a sharp
pang of bitterness that she had yielded so
quickly to my words. It seemed at the
moment that everything was passing out
of my life; that Phyllis, that Sylvia, that
all the once sweet, continuous memory was
lost to me forever. I could not call her
back, and I could not hope that she would
return. Philosopher that I was I could
not explain the sinking and the fear that
took possession of me. The philosopher
did not know himself. All his thought
and all his reasoning could not solve the
simple riddle the quick intuition of a girl
made clear.</p>

<p>She had reached the door before she
paused. Then she turned. I had risen
mechanically and stood looking at her.
As slowly she came back and waited as if
for me to speak. And when the dull<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142" href="#Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
philosopher groped helplessly for words
and could not meet the appealing eyes,
she put her hands on his shoulders, and
laid her warm, young face on his heart,
and said, "Father!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The night was peacefully beautiful.
I had strolled out of the garden and
down to the river, and there along the
bridle-path on the winding bank I walked
for miles. Absorbed in my own thoughts
I gave no heed to my little dog, Hero,
trotting at my side and looking anxiously
up at me with her large brown eyes,
as if saying in her dog fashion: "Don't
worry, old man; I'm here!" A strange,
inexplicable happiness had fallen to
him who thought he knew all others,
and did not know even himself. I
crossed the river to return on the opposite
shore, and all the way back, through
the arching trees, the shadows danced
in the moonlight and the crickets chirped
merrily. Life seemed so contrary, so
bewildering, for I thought of the wedding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143" href="#Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
music in those early mornings at my
boyhood home, and I wondered at the
optimism of Nature in attuning all emotions
to a joyous note.</p>

<p>Again in my garden I saw a half-light
in Phyllis's room. Coming nearer I saw
that she was standing at the window,
with the same cloud on her face that had
betrayed the battle with her conscience.
At sight of her all the joyous emotion of
my new tenderness overwhelmed me and
I cried out cheerily:</p>

<p>"Good-night, Phyllis!"</p>

<p>Something in my voice sent a smile
to her eyes and gladness to her heart, as,
half leaning from the window, she kissed
her hand to me and called back softly:
"Good-night, father dear!"</p>

<p>The south wind came, bringing the
scent of the rose and the honeysuckle,
and stirring the drowsy branches of the
elms. The river rippled merrily in the
moonlight, hurrying to bear the tidings
of happiness to the greater waters, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144" href="#Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
off in the distance the blue hills lifted
their heads above the haze. Toward the
north scudded the friendly little white
cloud, and it seemed again a soothing
fancy that Sylvia&mdash;</p>

<p>O sweet and pleasant world!</p>
